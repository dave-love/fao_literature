"5","Contextualizing the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on food security in two small cities in Bangladesh","Ruszczyk, H. A.; Rahman, M. F.; Bracken, L. J.; Sudha, S.","The COVID-19 pandemic is an evolving urban crisis. This research paper assesses impacts of the lockdown on food security and associated coping mechanisms in two small cities in Bangladesh (Mongla and Noapara) during March to May 2020. Due to restrictions during the prolonged lockdown, residents (in particular low-income groups) had limited access to livelihood opportunities and experienced significant or complete loss of income. This affected both the quantity and quality of food consumed. Coping strategies reported include curtailing consumption, relying on inexpensive starchy staples, increasing the share of total expenditure allocated to food, taking out loans and accessing relief. The pandemic has exacerbated the precariousness of existing food and nutrition security in these cities, although residents with guaranteed incomes and adequate savings did not suffer significantly during lockdown. While coping strategies and the importance of social capital are similar in small and large cities, food procurement and relationships with local governments show differences.",2021,"Environ Urban","33","1","239-254",34253941,"10.1177/0956247820965156","Asia"
"6","Qualitative assessment of COVID-19 impacts on aquatic food value chains in Bangladesh (Round 2)","Mamun, Abdullah-Al; Shieh, Jacqueline; Ben, Belton","Aquatic food value chains make up a large part of Bangladesh’s food system. In this report, we explore how actors in Bangladesh’s aquatic food supply chain have been affected by COVID-19. We conducted qualitative telephone interviews to elicit participants’ perceptions and experiences of the impacts of COVID-19 on different segments of the aquatic food supply chain. The work was designed to complement and add context to quantitative surveys of aquatic food supply chain actors that we conducted throughout 2020.
Two rounds of interviews were conducted in May and September 2020, covering the months of March-April and May-August, respectively to capture changes taking place over the progression of the pandemic. Forty-four participants were purposively sampled in the first round of interviews, and an additional 19 respondents were recruited for the second round for a total 63 respondents.
This report is divided into the following sections: (1) impacts on input suppliers; (2) impacts on producers, (3) impacts on retailers and wholesalers (4) impacts on consumers; and (5) experiences and perceptions of aid and assistance. Each section is further subdivided into findings from the first and second rounds of interviews.",2021,"","","","",NA,"","Asia"
"7","Guide to improving live fish transportation with special attention to the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh and other tropical developing countries","Rajts, Francois; Shelley, Colin C","The demand for live fish is high in Bangladesh, and because of this the price exceeds that for iced dead fish by BDT 20–30/kg. From observations taken in February–March 2020, the amount of live food fish transported to markets in Bangladesh is estimated at about 200 mt per day.

However, some farmers and traders use inappropriate transportation practices, which have led to health hazards during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, poor transportation techniques have resulted in high mortalities during shipping. Among those that do survive and make it to the market, many arrive in poor quality because of injuries sustained on the trip. On top of all this, these hazardous techniques also have dangerous impacts on road safety.

The main objective of this guide is to improve human safety during the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to harvesting and transporting live fish. Other objectives include (i) providing safer methods for handling and transportation, (ii) improving animal welfare, (iii) reducing road safety hazards, and (iv) detailing methods to reduce the cost of live fish transportation.",2020,"","","","",NA,"","Asia"
"8","Key indicators for monitoring food system disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic: Insights from Bangladesh towards effective response","Amjath-Babu, T. S.; Krupnik, T. J.; Thilsted, S. H.; McDonald, A. J.","In the context of developing countries, early evidence suggests that the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on food production systems is complex, heterogenous, and dynamic. As such, robust monitoring of the impact of the health crisis and containment measures across agricultural value chains will likely prove vitally important. With Bangladesh as a case study, we discuss the building blocks of a comprehensive monitoring system for prioritizing and designing interventions that respond to food system disruptions from COVID-19 and preemptively avoid further cascading negative effects. We also highlight the need for parallel research that identifies pathways for enhancing information flow, analysis, and action to improve the efficiency and reliability of input and output value chains. In aggregate, this preliminary work highlights the building blocks of resilient food systems to external shocks such as COVID-19 pandemic in the context of developing nations. In doing so, we call attention to the importance of 'infection safe' agricultural input and output distribution logistics, extended social safety nets, adequate credit facilities, and innovative labor management tools alongside, appropriate farm mechanization. In addition, digital extension services, circular nutrient flows, enhanced storage facilities, as well as innovative and robust marketing mechanisms are required. These should be considered in parallel with effective international trade management policies and institutions as crucial supportive measures.",2020,"Food Secur","12","4","761-768",32837652,"10.1007/s12571-020-01083-2","Asia"
"9","The purchase of organic fish in Bangladesh: Safeguarding against COVID-19","Prince, Sheikh Ashiqurrahman; Saira Wahid, Ishraat; Lu, Zhouxiang","Based on the theory of planned behaviour and cognitive dissonance, this research investigates how consumers' consciousness of the attributes of organic fish impacts the number of opportunities to purchase such fish at a safe social distance and how the consciousness of verbal recommendations affect the relationship between the consciousness of necessary social distance to safely buy organic fish and consumers' intention to purchase the fish. Applying these two theories and adding a new variable—social-distance purchasing—into the model, the research contributes significantly to current literature. Using a stratified random sampling, this research collected 320 data points from high, upper-middle and middle-income consumers that have been analysed through Amos Graphics and PROCESS macro in SPSS for the structural equation modelling. The findings of the research provide valuable insights to reduce the infection from COVID-19 as well as enhances the external validity and generalisability of the consumers' organic-food purchasing behaviour research.

S.; Sultana, R.; Ahmed, S. G.","In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic-induced nationwide lockdown (March-May) and the conservation-related 65-day fishing ban (May-July) in Bangladesh restricted its small-scale fishing folks from fishing for an unprecedented 130 days. This study assessed the resilience of two small-scale fishing communities in Barguna and Cox's Bazar districts against these subsequent disturbances. The research developed a conceptual framework based on Zurich Flood Resilience Alliance's ‘5 C-4R Framework’, which considers the relationships among a wide range of sources of resilience with livelihood capitals and resilience properties. By analyzing 100 interviews with marine fishers, this paper showed how weakened livelihood capitals affected the resilience of fishing communities. Dependency on a single income source, inadequate access to aid and financial and natural resources, lack of skills and knowledge on alternative livelihood options, absence of strong social protection and social networks, social inequalities, institutional incompetence, and lack of community leadership and cooperation severely affected fishers’ resilience. This study revealed that financial capital is directly linked with all resilience properties that require special attention to ensure fishers’ well-being. The paper recommended drastic investments in small-scale marine fishers through long-term livelihood improvement and asset creation, skills and knowledge development on natural-resource-based alternative income generation activities, and an exclusive social safety net program for these fisherfolks. The approach and findings of this study can guide other emerging economies who enjoy significant contributions from the marine fisheries sector to understand the resilience of their fishers and to address the prevailing challenges owing to the pandemic and other natural calamities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,"Marine Policy","134","","",NA,"10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104794","Asia"

B.","Purpose: This study intends to explore the impact of occupation and income on informal migrants in the face of COVID-19 induced lockdown in Bangladesh and their coping strategies to survive the pandemic situation. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopted a qualitative research design in which four urban areas were chosen purposively from various parts of Dhaka city. The authors conducted 21 semi-structured in-depth interviews, four FGDs and eight months over participant observation for achieving study objectives. The four stages of data analysis used a thematic approach in the interpretive phenomenological analysis. Findings: The results showed that respondents were massively affected due to loss of income and occupation in the period of induced lockdown. Besides, most people lost their earning sources entirely in this amid pandemic which bound them starvation in the mealtime along with several dynamic complications. The findings also revealed that they followed some surviving strategies such as taking loans, reducing expenses, consuming less food, selling land, jewelry, and goods, relatives and neighbor support, and government relief. Although these strategies somewhat supported them to struggle with the situation, their livelihood features became fragile immensely. Research limitations/implications: The findings will be an important guiding principle for the policymakers, aid organizations and development practitioners to prepare development policies for vulnerable informal migrants in developing countries like Bangladesh. Originality/value: This is the first study that explores the informal migrants’ occupation and income during COVID-19 induced lockdown in Bangladesh. This research also highlights coping strategies of the informal migrants to survive the pandemic situation. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2021,"International Journal of Sociology and Social Policy","","","",NA,"10.1108/IJSSP-02-2021-0046","Asia"
"13","Impacts of COVID-19 on the finfish aquaculture industry of Bangladesh: A case study","Hasan, N. A.; Heal, R. D.; Bashar, A.; Bablee, A. L.; Haque, M. M.","The COVID-19 outbreak, and the onset of a new normal, has shocked every entrepreneurial sector in Bangladesh including the burgeoning aquaculture sector. To unpack the COVID impacts on finfish aquaculture, two online based surveys were performed in Mymensingh, Bangladesh using structured questionnaires with 40 farmers to assess the economic feasibility of aquaculture farming, and 120 middlemen of the supply chain to unpack market instability. This was followed up with a further open-ended survey done with 120 consumers to gain a clear view of the marketing insights. Our study has revealed that COVID has resulted in a squeeze on profit for the finfish farmer and has opened up inequalities within the supply chain. Benefit-cost ratio analysis of farming reveals that although carp and other catfish farming remain close to the break-even level, pangasius and tilapia farming was potentially putting the farmers in debt. Whilst the consumers are now paying higher prices for pangasius and carp, and slightly reduced prices for tilapia and other catfish, the finfish farmers were receiving less profits. By contrast, the middlemen have increased their selling prices, presumably to offset increased costs and maintain profitability. To compensate rising operational costs and reduced income, farmers have reduced labor costs through reduction in number of staff and their wages. However, this compensation tool risks frustrating working-class people in rural areas and posing huge socio-economic burdens. Finally, the economic difficulties and a lack of support to process fish imposed by COVID restrictions have switched consumer's attitudes regarding fish as their protein source preference. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,"Marine Policy","130","","",NA,"10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104577","Asia"

Though a number of scientific studies have addressed the possible impacts of COVID-19 in Bangladesh on variety of issues, problems and food crises associated with aquatic resources and communities are missing. Therefore, this study aimed at bridging the gap in the existing situation and challenges of COVID-19 by linking its impact on aquatic food sector and small-scale fisheries with dependent population. The study was conducted based on secondary data analysis and primary fieldwork. Secondary data focused on COVID-19 overview and number of confirmed, recovered and death cases in Bangladesh; at the same time its connection with small-scale fisheries, aquatic food production, demand and supply was analyzed. Community perceptions were elicited to present how the changes felt and how they affected aquatic food system and small-scale fisheries and found devastating impact. Sudden illness, reduced income, complication to start production and input collection, labor crisis, transportation abstraction, complexity in food supply, weak value chain, low consumer demand, rising commodity prices, creditor's pressure were identified as the primary affecting drivers. Dependent people felt the measures taken by the Government should be based on protecting both the health and food security. Scope of alternative income generating opportunities, rationing system, training and motivational program could improve the situation.

M.","Fisheries and the aquaculture sector can play a significant role in the achievement of several of the goals of the 2030 Sustainable Development agenda. However, the current COVID-19 situation can negatively impact the fisheries sector, impeding the pace of the achievement of development goals. Therefore, this paper highlighted the performance and challenges of the fisheries sector in Bangladesh, emphasising the impact of COVID-19 and the significance of this sector for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), through primary fieldwork and secondary data. The total fish production in the country has increased more than six times over the last three decades (7.54 to 43.84 lakh MT) with improved culture techniques and extension services. Inland closed water contributions have increased to 16%, while inland open water has declined to 10%, and marine fisheries have dropped to 6% over the past 18 financial years (2000–2001 to 2018–2019). COVID-19, a significant health crisis, has also affected various issues associated with aquatic resources and communities. Transportation obstacles and complexity in the food supply, difficulty in starting production, labour crisis, sudden illness, insufficient consumer demand, commodity price hikes, creditor’s pressure, and reduced income were identified as COVID-19 drivers affecting the fisheries sector. The combined effect of these drivers poses a significant threat to a number of the SDGs, such as income (SDG1), nutrition (SDG2), and food security (SDG3 and SDG12), which require immediate and comprehensive action. Several recommendations were discussed, the implementation of which are important to the achievement of the SDGs and the improved management of the aquatic sector (SDG14—life below, and SDG16—life above water). © 2021 by the authors.

In developing countries like Bangladesh the situation is far worse. The purpose of this perspective is to highlight the current state and changes of food security in Bangladesh in the context of COVID-19. During the COVID-19 period, the income of a certain set of people fell, which may have contributed to the growth in the poverty rate. It also had an impact on the agro-food systems, supply-value chain, and market levels as a result of the lockdown, movement and social gathering restrictions.

G.; Hossain, M. S.; Khan, A. R.; Alam, M. A.; Ahmed, T.; Clemens, J. D.","INTRODUCTION: We conducted a cross-sectional survey to assess the extent and to identify the determinants of food insecurity and coping strategies in urban and rural households of Bangladesh during the month-long, COVID-19 lockdown period. SETTING: Selected urban and rural areas of Bangladesh. PARTICIPANTS: 106 urban and 106 rural households. OUTCOME VARIABLES AND METHOD: Household food insecurity status and the types of coping strategies were the outcome variables for the analyses. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were done to identify the determinants. RESULTS: We found that around 90% of the households were suffering from different grades of food insecurity. Severe food insecurity was higher in urban (42%) than rural (15%) households. The rural households with mild/moderate food insecurity adopted either financial (27%) or both financial and food compromised (32%) coping strategies, but 61% of urban mild/moderate food insecure households applied both forms of coping strategies. Similarly, nearly 90% of severely food insecure households implemented both types of coping strategies. Living in poorest households was significantly associated (p value <0.05) with mild/moderate (regression coefficient, β: 15.13, 95% CI 14.43 to 15.82), and severe food insecurity (β: 16.28, 95% CI 15.58 to 16.97). The statistically significant (p <0.05) determinants of both food compromised and financial coping strategies were living in urban areas (β: 1.8, 95% CI 0.44 to 3.09), living in poorest (β: 2.7, 95% CI 1 to 4.45), poorer (β: 2.6, 95% CI 0.75 to 4.4) and even in the richer (β: 1.6, 95% CI 0.2 to 2.9) households and age of the respondent (β: 0.1, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.21). CONCLUSION: Both urban and rural households suffered from moderate to severe food insecurity during the month-long lockdown period in Bangladesh. But, poorest, poorer and even the richer households adopted different coping strategies that might result in long-term economic and nutritional consequences.",2020,"BMJ Open","10","12","e043365",33310813,"10.1136/bmjopen-2020-043365","Asia"

A.; Pike, K.; Hasan, M. M.; Rahman, M. A.; Akter, S.; Mitchell, D.; Holliday, E.","COVID-19 has profoundly impacted global livelihoods and disrupted the food supply chain, including the aquaculture and fisheries industries. Little is known about the response to COVID-19 and the impact it has on incomes, livelihoods and knowledge and practice in the coastal artisanal fishers communities of Bangladesh. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the socio-demographics of selected coastal fishers, their knowledge about COVID-19 and the preventive practice taken to reduce it. The impact on their fishing habits and income was also examined to determine potential policy areas. Data were collected via a structured questionnaire from 250 respondents from three coastal districts, Cox's Bazar, Patuakhali and Barguna, Bangladesh during April-June 2020. The research shows that the fishers' knowledge about COVID-19 and measures taken to reduce it were significantly higher in Patuakhali and Barguna than in Cox's Bazar. The pandemic caused lower consumer demand, reduced fish prices and created fish transportation issues due to movement restrictions enforced during the lockdown. Irrespective of geographical location, fishing trips were reduced by frequency and duration compared with the pre-COVID-19 period, consequently lowering the income of fishers. Fishers have received little or no support from private, non-governmental or governmental sources. Considering the evidence in this paper of economic hardship, this paper recommends artisanal fishers in Bangladesh should be provided with support to improve their health education, access to professional health facilities and financial services. This will contribute to improved food security and sustainable livelihoods that can better withstand local and/or global crises.",2021,"Mar Policy","131","","104647",34511705,"10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104647","Asia"

In this case, the COVID-19 pandemic has multiplied the food insecurity of informal migrant workers. This study explores and synthesizes the COVID-19 induced food insecurity impact among informal migrants and recommends policy actions to tackle the COVID-19 led food crisis in Bangladesh. A qualitative research approach, including in-depth interviews, four FGDs, and participant observation, has been applied to data collection from different parts of Dhaka city. A thematic approach to interpretive phenomenological analysis is followed in this study. The results show that COVID-19 induced lockdown significantly affects informal migrants' household food security. Most participants report severe complications due to food insecurity like consuming less food, price hiking, no fish or meat, potato, and vegetable. Food insecurity leads to migrant's chronic food shortage, starvation, malnutrition of mother and children, and unhealthy food. As a result, the way of life of informal migrants has been directed to more fragility and vulnerability during the pandemic; even they are not affordable to maintain a minimal level of family affairs and necessity. The findings of this study would be essential guidelines for the governmental and non-governmental organizations and development practitioners to address the food insecurity situations.",2021,"J Public Aff","","","e2770",34899062,"10.1002/pa.2770","Asia"

A.","The effects of COVID-19 are continuing to increase around the world as the pandemic claims thousands of lives. Bangladesh is no exception and has been greatly affected by SARS-CoV-2. Apart from the number of people who are or have been directly getting infected with this disease, millions of people are directly or indirectly facing many challenges to their livelihoods and the security of their food and nutritional supply, along with other societal issues created by the pandemic. In this study, a hybrid approach of online and telephone questionnaire surveys was used to investigate the food security of Dhaka city's inhabitants at household level. Approximately 80% of the respondents reported reduced income, and a quarter of respondents lost their jobs between March and June 2020. The frequency of fish consumption, an essential component of Bangladeshi diets, significantly reduced during the pandemic. This was especially apparent in affluent segments of the community. Out of the respondents, 75% reported an increase in the price of fish in Dhaka city. A range of coping strategies were observed: including decreasing the frequency of grocery shopping, shifting to online shopping, reducing consumption of high price commodities, reducing junk food consumption, cleaning fish and meat with hot water and vinegar, and increasing the consumption of protein and vitamin C rich food items. Prior to COVID-19, 80% of the households surveyed bought fish from wet markets. This number dropped to 45% during the pandemic. Many households substituted fish and meat with poultry, eggs and dried fish. About half of the households stockpiled rice, lentils and potatoes during the peak of the pandemic. However, if the pandemic lasts for a prolonged period, those living on low incomes in urban areas will experience some level of food insecurity from a reduced income or loss of work. Because of this, a large-scale sustainability policy should be undertaken to secure the food and nutritional security of low-income and middle-class household. © 2021",2021,"Global Food Security","29","","",NA,"10.1016/j.gfs.2021.100526","Asia"
"24","Impact of novel coronavirus pandemic on aquaculture and fisheries in developing countries and sustainable recovery plans: Case of Bangladesh","Islam, M. M.; Khan, M. I.; Barman, A.","Like most sectors, the aquaculture and fisheries sector especially in developing countries like Bangladesh is believed to have been severely affected by this unique coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. To overcome the adverse impacts of COVID-19, the aquaculture and fisheries economy needs urgent recovery plans which this study focusses on using a mixed-method including online questionnaire surveys, face-to-face and telephonic interviews and focus group discussions during June – November 2020. This study reveals some positive impacts on ecosystem and fish stock (e.g., increase in fish stock) due to less disturbance of fishing activities, but that are not able to bring societal benefits as all the fisheries sub-sectors are affected differently by the pandemic. There are disrupted transportation systems and increased transportation costs (around 20 – 60% higher than normal), more input and maintenance costs and less demand for/and decreased market price of fish. There are also shortages of labourers and reduced patrolling to implement fishery regulations. Cancellation of orders by foreign buyers has seriously affected the shrimp and crab sub-sectors. The fisheries-dependent people's capital assets and activities have been mostly negatively affected resulting in a worsened livelihood. This study has suggested a set of immediate and long-term changes to policy and action plans to recover this sector and sub-sectors from the pandemic considering economic, social and environmental sustainability. The findings of this study may have important implications not only for Bangladesh but also for other fisheries dependent developing countries with similar impacts by the virus like in South Asia. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,"Marine Policy","131","","",NA,"10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104611","Asia"

T.; Bhowmik, J.; Ahmed, S. G.","The unusual situation that arose due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the 65-day fishing ban (national policy to boost depleted fish stocks) affected the lower-income fishing communities in coastal Bangladesh. Shocks and stresses were posed, and community people adopted strategies to adapt to the changes. In the process of adaptation, social-ecological systems resilience at different levels plays a crucial role. Though resilience is acknowledged as multilevel feature, studies on the interaction between the levels while understanding communities’ responses to shock and stress are limited. Thus, in this study, we explored the shocks and stresses the fishing community faced and their views on the resilience feature at different levels (i.e., individual, household, and community level) in coastal Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic and 65-day fishing ban period. The study found that the most resilience promoting features (e.g., diversified livelihood, friendship, and network of supports) were adopted at the individual and household levels. However, positive and negative interactions were explored between resilience features at all levels. Low community-level resilience was not translated into a lack of household-level resilience, and strong individual-level resilience did not mean high household-level resilience. It was noted that the increased resilience of a particular individual or household could negatively affect community resilience. Resilience features showed inconsistent interactions within or among the three levels’ resilience features. The study also revealed that multilevel resilience features stressed the importance of combining persistence (i.e., keeping fishing as the main livelihood) and adaptation process (e.g., livelihood diversification). The study showcases the importance of considering multilevel resilience that offers insight into crucial resilience factors which would not be evident if only one level were studied. The overall finding of this study will contribute to framing governance strategies to ensure sustainable coastal management even in the time of any abrupt or expected changes, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the fishing ban policy. © Copyright © 2021 Sultana, Irfanullah, Selim, Raihan, Bhowmik and Ahmed.",2021,"Frontiers in Marine Science","8","","",NA,"10.3389/fmars.2021.721838","Asia"

This study compares shrimp farmers’ livelihood status before and during the COVID-19 pandemic by employing the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework (SLF) developed by the Department for International Development (DFID). A total of 250 shrimp farmers were surveyed to achieve the objectives. Findings indicated that COVID-19 had a detrimental effect on the livelihood status of shrimp farmers. The total livelihood diversification score was higher (0.53) before COVID-19 than during COVID-19 (0.43). During COVID-19, the cost of shrimp production increased considerably compared to before COVID-19, reducing profitability.

S.; Brazendale, K.; Harris, J.; Mandal, M.; Jahan, I.; Abid, M. T.; Khan, M. S. I.","OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to determine the associated factors of household food security (HFS) and household dietary diversity (HDD) during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. DESIGN: Both online survey and face-to-face interviews were employed in this cross-sectional study. The Household Food Security Scale and Household Dietary Diversity Score were used to access HFS and HDD, respectively. The HDD scores were derived from a 24-h recall of food intake from 12 groups. SETTING: Bangladesh. PARTICIPANTS: A total sample of 1876 households were recruited. RESULTS: The overall mean scores of HFS and HDD were 31·86 (sd 2·52) and 6·22 (sd 5·49), respectively. Being a rural resident, having no formal education, occupation of household head other than government job and low monthly income were potential determinants of lower HFS and HDD. Approximately 45 % and 61 % of Bangladeshi households did not get the same quantity and same type of food, respectively, as they got before the pandemic. Over 10 % of respondents reported that they lost their job or had to close their businesses, and income reduction was reported by over 70 % of household income earners during the COVID-19 pandemic, which in turn was negatively associated with HFS and HDD. CONCLUSION: Household socio-economic variables and COVID-19 effects on occupation and income are potential predictors of lower HFS and HDD scores. HFS and HDD deserve more attention during this pandemic particularly with reference to low-earning households and the households whose earning persons' occupation has been negatively impacted during the COVID-19 pandemic.",2021,"Public Health Nutr","24","5","1079-1087",33317657,"10.1017/s1368980020005042","Asia"

It is therefore essential to explore the livelihood conditions, health status and care-seeking behavior of the fishermen in these communities during the ongoing pandemic. This study was carried out by applying mixed methods, including interviews and focus group discussion (FGD), in the three sub-districts of Khulna, Satkhira, and Bagerhat, which are in the southwestern region adjacent to the Sundarbans mangrove forest (SMF) of Bangladesh. Quantitative data were collected from 76 fishermen through telephone interviews, while 24 fishermen participated in three distinct focus group discussions. The findings suggest that the fishermen have experienced a reduction of income, as they have been barred from entering the SMF during the pandemic, which has gradually affected their number of trips to and stays at the forest as well as their catch of fisheries resources. The decline in demand in both regional and international markets has left the fishermen with only a handful of alternative ways to adjust to these unprecedented circumstances, such as borrowing money, selling household assets, and in some extreme cases marrying off young children to reduce the financial burden, as many are now jobless. Their financial hardship during the pandemic has affected their households' capacity to afford basic household necessities, including food, fuel, education, and health expenses. Subsequently, when these fishermen suffer ailments such as fever, cough, headache, and cold - the general symptoms of COVID-19 - they cannot seek medical assistance from trained doctors. Their financial constraints have compelled them to rely on indigenous knowledge, in particular village quack doctors, or in some cases to seek help from local pharmacies for modern medicine.

Here, rigorous evidence of the impacts of COVID-19 on several livelihood outcomes are presented, with a particular focus on heterogenous effects of COVID-19. We use a household-level panel dataset consisting of 880 data points collected in rural Bangladesh in 2018 and 2020, and employ difference-in-differences with fixed effects regression techniques. Results suggest that COVID-19 had significant and heterogenous effects on livelihood outcomes. Agricultural production and share of production sold were reduced, especially for rice crops. Further, diet diversity and education expenditure were reduced for the total sample. Households primarily affected by (fear of) sickness had a significantly lower agricultural production, share of crop market sales, and lower health and education expenditure, compared to households affected by other COVID-19 effects, such as travel restrictions. In turn, (fear of) sickness and the correlated reduced incidence of leaving the house, resulted in higher off-farm incomes suggesting that households engage in less physically demanding and localized work. Policy-makers need to be cognizant of these heterogenous COVID-19 effects and formulate policies that are targeted at those households that are most vulnerable (e.g., unable/willing to leave the house due to (fear of) sickness).",2021,"PLoS ONE","16","11","e0259264",34843495,"10.1371/journal.pone.0259264","Asia"

OBJECTIVES: Identifying the changes in eating habits and lifestyles including, physical activity, sleeping hours, and sleep quality after the cancellation of lockdown than the period of restrictions. METHODS: A quasi-experimental cross-sectional study was conducted among 394 students in Bangladesh using a structured questionnaire from February 3, 2021, to February 13, 2021. RESULTS: Consuming homemade foods drops by 8.63% at post lockdown than lockdown period. At post lockdown, 26.67% of students gained weight whereas 47.46% of respondents never engaged in any physical works. There has been a significant correlation between weight gain and physical activities (p = 0.007).

Because of the very high rate of infection by the delta variant of this virus, the use of PPEs by the public is increased significantly to protect the ingestion/inhalation of respiratory droplets in the air. However, it is a matter of solicitude that general people throw away the PPEs to the dwelling environment unconsciously. With the increase of inappropriate disposal of PPEs (i.e., mostly the disposable face masks made from plastic microfibers), the possibility of transmission of the virus to the general public cannot be neglected completely. This is because this virus can survive for several days on the inanimate matter like plastics and fibers. At the same time, the result of environmental contamination by microplastic/microfiber has been widespread which eventually creates the worst impact on ecosystems and organisms.

S.; Timsina, J.","Context: The COVID-19 pandemic has been affecting health and economies across the world, although the nature of direct and indirect effects on Asian agrifood systems and food security has not yet been well understood. Objectives: This paper assesses the initial responses of major farming and food systems to COVID-19 in 25 Asian countries, and considers the implications for resilience, food and nutrition security and recovery policies by the governments. Methods: A conceptual systems model was specified including key pathways linking the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 to the resilience and performance of the four principal Asian farming and food systems, viz, lowland rice based; irrigated wheat based; hill mixed; and dryland mixed systems. Based on this framework, a systematic survey of 2504 key informants (4% policy makers, 6% researchers or University staff, 6% extension workers, 65% farmers, and 19% others) in 20 Asian countries was conducted and the results assessed and analysed. Results and conclusion: The principal Asian farming and food systems were moderately resilient to COVID-19, reinforced by government policies in many countries that prioritized food availability and affordability. Rural livelihoods and food security were affected primarily because of disruptions to local labour markets (especially for off-farm work), farm produce markets (notably for perishable foods) and input supply chains (i.e., seeds and fertilisers). The overall effects on system performance were most severe in the irrigated wheat based system and least severe in the hill mixed system, associated in the latter case with greater resilience and diversification and less dependence on external inputs and long market chains. Farming and food systems' resilience and sustainability are critical considerations for recovery policies and programmes, especially in relation to economic performance that initially recovered more slowly than productivity, natural resources status and social capital. Overall, the resilience of Asian farming and food systems was strong because of inherent systems characteristics reinforced by public policies that prioritized staple food production and distribution as well as complementary welfare programmes. With the substantial risks to plant- and animal-sourced food supplies from future zoonoses and the institutional vulnerabilities revealed by COVID-19, efforts to improve resilience should be central to recovery programmes. Significance: This study was the first Asia-wide systems assessment of the effects of COVID-19 on agriculture and food systems, differentiating the effects of the pandemic across the four principal regional farming and food systems in the region. © 2021",2021,"Agricultural Systems","193","","",NA,"10.1016/j.agsy.2021.103168","Asia"

M.","Face masks are playing an essential role in preventing the spread of COVID-19. Face masks such as N95, and surgical masks, contain a considerable portion of non-recyclable plastic material. Marine plastic pollution is likely to increase due to the rapid use and improper dispensing of face masks, but until now, no extensive quantitative estimation exists for coastal regions. Linking behaviour dataset on face mask usage and solid waste management dataset, this study estimates annual face mask utilization and plastic pollution from mismanaged face masks in coastal regions of 46 countries. It is estimated that approximately 0.15 million tons to 0.39 million tons of plastic debris could end up in global oceans within a year. With lower waste management facilities, the number of plastic debris entering the ocean will rise.

In most low- and middle-income countries, micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) play an essential role in food supply chains and thus in ensuring food and nutrition security. However, limited attention has been paid to how these critical food system actors are being impacted by the pandemic and associated measures. This paper helps fill that gap through analysis of data from 367 agri-food MSMEs in 17 countries, collected in May 2020 and capturing early impacts of the pandemic on their operations. About 94.3% of respondents reported that their firm's operations had been impacted by the pandemic, primarily through decreased sales as well as lower access to inputs and financing amid limited financial reserves. Difficulty with staffing was also widely cited. Eighty-four percent of firms reported changing their production volume as a result of the pandemic; of these, about 13% reported stopping production and about 82% reported decreasing production. Approximately 54% had changed product prices as a result of the pandemic. The probability of being severely impacted was significantly higher for firms with <50,000 USD in annual turnover; a larger decrease in consumer mobility for grocery/pharmacy shopping also increased the probability of a severe impact. Surprisingly, the youngest firms and those with the fewest employees (controlling for turnover) were less likely to be severely impacted. Over 80% of firms had taken actions to mitigate the pandemic's impact on their operations and/or staff, and about 44% were considering exploring new business areas, with some seeing opportunities for growth. We conclude by discussing implications for policy responses to address immediate challenges as well as increase long-term food system resilience to support further progress towards sustainable development.

A multi-country survey was conducted in 16 countries involving 825 food companies. Based on the results of the survey, it is obvious that the level of maturity of a food safety system in place is the main trigger in classifying companies and their responses to the pandemic challenge. Staff awareness and hygiene are the two most important attributes in combating Covid-19, opposed to temperature checking of workers in food establishment and health protocols from the World Health Organization, recognized as attributes with limited salience and importance. Companies confirmed implementation of more restrictive hygiene procedures during the pandemic and the need for purchasing more additional personal protective equipment. Retailers were identified as the food supply chain link mostly affected by the pandemic opposed to food storage facilities ranked as least affected.

L.","The ASEAN comprises 10 member states and is a fast developing region in which agriculture has historically been important for food security and livelihoods. However, over the past decade, agriculture's contribution to national economies, as well as the labor force engaged in agriculture have been declining. Prior to the onset of the COVID pandemic, ASEAN countries already faced challenges to their food production capacity due to climate-related phenomena, declining arable land and freshwater resources and the ever-present pests and diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted lives and disrupted livelihoods in the ASEAN region, and this remains an important concern given recurring waves of infections as economies reopen. This chapter discusses the impact of COVID-19 on food security dimensions concerned with food production, the supply chain from “farm to table,” food affordability and nutrition among consumers, particularly the poor. It begins by providing a review of Southeast Asia's socio-economic landscape which influences food security and a discussion on distinctive features of its food systems which affect food security in the region, prior to COVID-19. It then discusses the impact of the pandemic on the region, and how ASEAN member states have responded, and describes what the “New Normal” is likely to be. It concludes with suggestions on how ASEAN is likely to move ahead post-pandemic. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",2021,"Advances in Food Security and Sustainability","6","","83-118",NA,"10.1016/bs.af2s.2021.07.001","Asia"

In this paper, we assess the impacts of responses to the COVID-19 pandemic on aquaculture farmers in five countries in the Mekong Region. A total of 1,019 farmers were surveyed (June–August 2020). The COVID-19 pandemic reduced farmer mobility, disrupted input and produce logistics, and reduced consumer demand, which in turn, reduced net income relative to expectations and increased the likelihood of making a net loss in the first half of 2020. Large aquaculture farms were more likely to experience adverse impacts from higher input prices and lower fish market prices than small farms. Intensive and commercial farms were more likely to be affected by supplier and buyer logistic disruptions. Coping responses included adjustments to stocking practices, reducing labor inputs, finding new markets, drawing on savings, and borrowing money. Large farms were more likely to seek new markets and borrow money. Easier loan conditions and direct cash handouts by governments helped in some locations and were desired in others. Significant differences among countries in impacts and responses reflect market and trade dependencies, as well as government capacity and willingness to support the aquaculture industry. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2021,"Aquaculture Economics and Management","25","3","298-319",NA,"10.1080/13657305.2021.1946205","Asia"

This study investigates whether there were any changes in the water quality of the Lower Min River (China) during the lockdown period. The time-series remote sensing images from November 2019 to April 2020 was used to examine the dynamics of the river's total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations in the period. A new remote sensing-based prototype was developed to recalibrate an existing algorithm for retrieving TSS concentrations in the river. The Nechad and the Novoa algorithms were used to validate the recalibrated algorithm. The results show that the recalibrated algorithm is highly consistent with the two algorithms. All of the three algorithms indicate significant fluctuation in TSS concentrations in the Lower Min River during the study period. February (COVID-19 lockdown period) has witnessed a 48% fall in TSS concentration. The TSS in March–April showed a progressive and recovery back to normal levels of pre-COVID-19. The spatiotemporal change of TSS has worked as a good indicator of human activities, which revealed that the decline of TSS in the lockdown period was due largely to the substantially-reduced discharges from industrial estates, densely-populated city center, and river's shipping. Remote sensing monitoring of the spatiotemporal changes of TSS helps understand important contributors to the water-quality changes in the river and the impacts of anthropogenic activities on river systems. © 2021 The Author(s)",2021,"International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation","98","","",NA,"10.1016/j.jag.2021.102301","Asia"
"45","Early impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the molluscan shellfish supply chain in China","Zhang, S.; Mu, Y.; Sun, Y.","A farm-level survey and a market survey were conducted in China to study the impact of the COVID-19 on the shellfish supply chain in the early stage of the pandemic in 2020. 114 farms of 36 cites participated in an online survey from mid-July to late August, and 23 markets in five cities were investigated from June to November. The series results are expected to provide an insight for the fisheries and aquaculture sector to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on participants in the shellfish supply chain and to improve of the ability of the government to respond to such events in the future. Shellfish farmers and sellers have experienced a sharp drop in profits, largely due to shrinking demand. Relying on local employees and suppliers, shellfish farming activities have rapidly resumed since the gradual reopening from February. Nevertheless, demand has been slow to recover due to public concern about contamination of seafood with the virus. Additionally, we analyzed the ability and attitude of farms of different size to cope with the pandemic and the plight of shellfish sellers, and discussed government supports for different size farms and improvements in seafood distribution channels.",2021,"Ocean Coast Manag","213","","105852",34642554,"10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.105852","Asia"

Our study uses panel data from 2,201 primary school students and 1,341 junior high-school students to apply the difference in differences (DID) method to estimate the impact of COVID-19 on dietary diversity among students in urban and rural families. We found that the dietary diversity score (DDS) of rural students decreased by 0.295 points (p < 0.01) compared with that of urban students during COVID-19. Specifically, COVID-19 significantly reduced the frequency of rural students' consumption of vegetables by 1.8 percent, protein-rich foods such as soybean products and nuts by 6.0 percent, meats by 4.0 percent, aquatic products by 6.7 percent, and eggs by 5.3 percent, compared with urban students. Further, COVID-19 had a significant negative effect on the dietary diversity of students from low- and middle-income groups, with the DDS of the low-income group decreasing by 0.31 points (p < 0.01) and that of the middle-income group by 0.12 points (p < 0.1). © 2021 Institute of World Economics and Politics, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences",2021,"China and World Economy","29","6","53-72",NA,"10.1111/cwe.12394","Asia"

"48","Consumer behavior and food prices during the COVID‐19 pandemic: Evidence from Chinese cities","Yang, Bixuan; Asche, Frank; Li, Tao","We find that Chinese consumers responded strongly to government restrictions during the COVID‐19 crisis. Our event‐study framework shows that emergency declarations raised average food prices by as much as 7.8 standard deviations of the price change distribution, with a much larger effect on non‐perishable vegetable prices (e.g., 17.0 standard deviations for Chinese cabbage prices). The effects of lockdowns were smaller but longer‐lasting. These results suggest that consumers panic bought non‐perishables under emergency declarations while under lockdowns there was a sustained increase in demand for non‐perishables. Such consumer behavior likely caused sizable losses in consumer welfare, especially among poor households. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

"49","COVID-19 lockdown improved river water quality in China","Liu, D.; Yang, H.; Thompson, J. R.; Li, J.; Loiselle, S.; Duan, H.","The impacts of COVID-19 lockdowns on air quality around the world have received wide attention. In comparison, assessments of the implications for water quality are relatively rare. As the first country impacted by COVID-19, China implemented local and national lockdowns that shut down industries and businesses between January and May 2020. Based on monthly field measurements (N = 1693) and daily automonitoring (N = 65), this study analyzed the influence of the COVID-19 lockdown on river water quality in China. The results showed significant improvements in river water quality during the lockdown period but out-of-step improvements for different indicators. Reductions in ammonia nitrogen (NH(4)(+)-N) began relatively soon after the lockdown; chemical oxygen demand (COD) and dissolved oxygen (DO) showed improvements beginning in late January/early February and mid-March, respectively, while increases in pH were more temporally concentrated in the period from mid-March to early May. Compared to April 2019, the Water Quality Index increased at 67.4% of the stations in April 2020, with 75.9% of increases being significant. Changes in water quality parameters also varied spatially for different sites and were mainly determined by the locations and levels of economic development. After the lifting of the lockdown in June, all water quality parameters returned to pre-COVID-19 lockdown conditions. Our results clearly demonstrate the impacts of human activities on water quality and the potential for reversing ecosystem degradation by better management of wastewater discharges to replicate the beneficial impacts of the COVID-19 lockdown. CAPSULE SUMMARY: River water quality improved during China's COVID-19 lockdown, but returned to normal conditions after the lockdown.",2022,"Sci Total Environ","802","","149585",34454149,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149585","Asia"

This study examines these challenges through an observation of China's fish import and export activities and a qualitative study on evolving policies in the first nine months of 2020. The results indicate that control measures responding to uncertainty regarding the source of the disease and transmission path, the pressing need for restriction of the movement of people and goods, and fear of a second wave of outbreaks have substantially disrupted fish trade. To meet these challenges, certain coping measures are adopted to offset negative effects in the short term. These measures indicate the government's pivotal role in stabilizing the supply chain and striking a balance between control requirements and efficiency required in trading activities, as well as the importance to find alternative markets to mitigate risks brought by the delayed supply and the plummeting consumption market.

The pandemic has been seriously affecting public health and national and global economies since the beginning of 2020. By 3 November 2020, the world's cumulative reported infections exceeded 46 million and the number of deaths reached 1.2 million (WHO 2020). The rapid spread of COVID-19 and its induced pandemic control through territory lockdown, travel bans and many other restrictions imposed on people's movements have seriously affected the economy of all countries across the world. Worldwide, the pandemic has significantly affected food systems, particularly agricultural inputs and outputs markets, food processing and employment along food value chains, which has exacerbated poverty and food and nutrition insecurity. The latest FAO report on the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World estimates that the COVID-19 pandemic could add 130 million people worldwide suffering from chronic hunger in 2020 (FAO et al. 2020).

"53","Building resilient food system amidst COVID-19: Responses and lessons from China","Zhan, Y.; Chen, K. Z.","CONTEXT: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread over the world and has heightened concerns over global food security risks. As the first country hit by COVID-19, China has adopted a series of stringent mitigation policies to contain the spread of virus. This has led to food system disruptions due to restrictions on labor and interruption of transport, processing, retailing, and input distribution. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this contribution is to report evidence for initial impacts and resilience of China's food system amid the COVID-19 pandemic and to discuss government's responses as well as long-term efforts that promoted resilience. METHODS: We reviewed a range of publications, government released reports and official information, blogs, and media articles, and whenever possible, we complemented this qualitative information with quantitative data from China's National Bureau of Statistics and finally empirical data obtained from a simulation study. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We identified China's earlier responses in each key food system activities including ensuring effective logistics of agricultural products and inputs, supporting production and processing, matching supply with demand, and mitigating consumer's income loss. In particular, innovative information and communications technology (ICT) applications along the food system had been highlighted. Coupled with China's long-term efforts in investing in agriculture, building emergency response systems, and adopting governor's responsibility mechanisms, there has been little panic in the food system with largely sufficient supplies and stable prices. In the second quarter of 2020, after registered negative growth in the first quarter, primary agriculture grew by 3.4% and the negative growth of livestock production was narrowed significantly by 8.7 percentage points. Food prices rose by a modest 0.6% and returned to normal after a surge in February 2020. SIGNIFICANCE: We expect that China's experiences on building resilient food systems could improve understanding of the challenges posed by COVID-19 from a retrospective perspective and provide lessons to other countries that are experiencing disruptions in the food systems worldwide. The lessons are also important for strengthening the resilience of food systems over longer time horizons. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,"Agricultural Systems","190","","",NA,"10.1016/j.agsy.2021.103102","Asia"

C.; Lin, C. H.; Wu, V. C. H.; Lin, C. S.","COVID-19 has brought speculations on potential transmission routes of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causal agent of the pandemic. It is reported that the main route of virus transmission to be person-to-person by respiratory droplets; however, people have raised concerns on the possible transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to humans via food and packaging and its potential effects on food safety. This review discusses food safety issues in the COVID-19 pandemic and reveals its possible transmission in cold-chain food. The first outbreak of COVID-19 in late 2019 was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan, China, while the second outbreak of COVID-19 in June 2020 was also related to a seafood market in Beijing, China. As of 2020, several frozen seafood products linked with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported in China. According to the current survey and scientific studies, the risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2 from cold-chain food, food products, and food packaging is thought to be very low. However, studies on food cold chain contamination have shown that SARS-CoV-2 remained highly stable under refrigerated (4°C) and even in freezing conditions (-10 to -80°C). Since one mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission appears to be touching contaminated surfaces, it is important to clean and sanitize food contact surfaces properly. Understanding food safety hazard risks is essential to avoid potential negative health effects and SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the food supply chain during the COVID-19 pandemic.",2021,"J Food Saf","","","e12932",34898751,"10.1111/jfs.12932","Asia"
"55","To buy or not buy food online: The impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the adoption of e-commerce in China","Gao, X.; Shi, X.; Guo, H.; Liu, Y.","Drawing on a recent online survey combined with city-level data, this paper examines the impact of the COVID-19 on consumers' online food purchase behavior in the short term. To address the potential endogeneity issues, we adopt an instrumental variable (IV) strategy, using the distance from the surveyed city to Wuhan as the instrumental variable. We show that our IV method is effective in minimizing potential bias. It is found that the share of confirmed COVID-19 cases increases the possibility of consumers purchasing food online. This is more likely to be the case for young people having a lower perceived risk of online purchases and living in large cities. Despite some limitations, this paper has policy implications for China and other countries that have been influenced by the COVID-19 epidemic. Specifically, government support and regulation should focus on (i) ensuring the safety of food sold on the internet, (ii) protecting the carrier from becoming infected, and (iii) providing financial support to the poor since they may have difficulties in obtaining access to food living in small cities. Moreover, how to help those who are unable to purchase food online because of their technical skills (e.g., the elderly who are not familiar with smart phones or the internet) also deserves more attention for the government and the public.",2020,"PLoS ONE","15","8","e0237900",32817693,"10.1371/journal.pone.0237900","Asia"

"58","Overstocked Agricultural Produce and Emergency Supply System in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Responses from China","Pu, M.; Chen, X.; Zhong, Y.","The spread of COVID-19 has affected not only public health but also agriculture, raising global concerns regarding the food system. As an immediate impact of COVID-19, farmers around the globe have had difficulties with sales, resulting in large amounts of overstocked agricultural products and food loss. This further threatens the livelihood of rural, poor farmers and impacts sustainable production. To provide a better understanding of the overstocking situation after the outbreak of the pandemic, this study depicts the distribution characteristics of overstocked agricultural products in China. After analyzing a nationwide data set collected from 3482 individuals/organizations by the Chinese Agri-products Marketing Association after the outbreak of the pandemic, we found that some of the initial prevention and control measures disrupted sales channels, and in turn, caused the farmers to suffer losses. The impact was more severe in perishable products and their production areas, as well as in poverty-stricken regions. Then, we identified China's quick and effective actions to match the supply and demand. These findings suggest that emergency responses should coordinate the relationship between emergency actions and the necessary logistics of agricultural production. To prepare for the possibility of such shock in the future, the government should take actions to clear logistics obstacles for necessary transportation, keep enhancing the fundamental infrastructure and effective mechanism of the food supply chain, and actively include innovative techniques to build a more resilient food system.",2021,"Foods","10","12","",34945577,"10.3390/foods10123027","Asia"

In our study, a rapid assessment questionnaire was used to investigate the change of household life and dietary intake of the elderly (aged 60 years or more) during community closure. Food consumption frequency of aquatic food products, soybeans, and fresh fruits declined dramatically with reductions of 70.9%, 70.9%, and 53.0%, respectively, and 49.6% of the elderly lived with chronic non-communicable diseases but had little knowledge of nutrition and health. What are the implications for public health practice? Community closure measures in Wuhan City have played a key role in cutting off the transmission route of COVID-19 and protecting vulnerable groups. As a high-risk population, the elderly should be advised to maintain and strengthen a balanced diet with proper nutrition through increasing intake of aquatic food products, soybeans, fruits, and vegetables, reducing total caloric intake, and decreasing oil and salt consumption.

This study aimed to (1) explore the dietary diversity during the lockdown time in China and (2) examine factors associated with dietary diversity including socio-economic characteristics, sources for food and food purchases, and specific dietary behaviors responding to COVID-19 and isolation. A cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey was conducted online in March 2020. Multi-stage sampling was used to recruit participants living in Hubei Province and other parts of China. Dietary diversity was assessed using the Household Dietary Diversity Score (HDDS) and clustering analysis was used to categorize people with different propensities of methods for purchasing or obtaining foods. Logistic regression was used to model the associations among HDDS, participants' characteristics, approaches to purchase or obtain food, and behaviors adopted to cope with COVID-19. Results: A total of 1938 participants were included in the analysis. The overall mean HDDS was 9.7 ± 2.1, and the median (25th, 75th) was 10 (8, 12). There were relatively low consumptions of fish, legumes, and miscellaneous foods (e.g., processed food like snacks and beverages). After adjusting for age, family income, and geographic regions, people living in places where laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases were above 500 (OR(adjusted) = 0.79, 95%CI 0.65, 0.96), or living in Hubei Province (OR(adjusted) = 0.60, 95%CI 0.39, 0.93) had a lower HDDS. During isolation time, the most common sources for food and food purchases were in-house storage and in person grocery shopping. More than half of the participants (55.9%) purchased food at least once via online ordering and delivery services. There was no significant difference in HDDS among people with distinct dependences on different ways to obtain or purchase food (i.e., dependence on in-person grocery shopping, dependence on both in-house storage and in-person grocery shopping, or dependence on online food purchasing). We also identified a total of 37.7% participants who consumed certain foods or nutritional supplements to cope with COVID-19, which included vitamin C, probiotics, other dietary supplements, alcohol, and vinegar. People who reported these specific dietary behaviors had a significantly higher HDDS (OR(adjusted) = 1.23, 95%CI 1.02, 1.45) than those who did not do so. This study revealed an overall good dietary diversity among the studied Chinese residents during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we observed a lower dietary diversity among people living in areas with a high number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Online ordering and delivery services were popular and could serve as a feasible method to obtain and purchase food, contributing to ensure diversified diets during the time of lockdown. Certain dietary behaviors associated with COVID-19 were also identified and had significant impacts on HDDS.",2020,"Nutrients","12","6","",32517210,"10.3390/nu12061699","Asia"
"61","Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on agricultural exports","Lin, B. X.; Zhang, Y. Y.","The COVID-19 outbreak has shocked the world's economies in the year of 2020. As this pandemic spreads around the globe, many experts feared that the global food supplies might start running short, especially if supply chains were disrupted. COVID-19 also added to the uncertainty of the business operation. Therefore, it is critical to understand how COVID-19 pandemic affected global food supply and market. In this study, we investigate the impact of COVID-19 on agricultural export companies in China using a unique firm-level survey data. We found that although on average agricultural businesses experienced declines in the exports, exports of some agricultural products especially grain and oil held strong and even increased, implying the essential demand for staple food during the pandemic. Not surprisingly, exports of medicinal herb also increased significantly during the pandemic. However, exports of goods such as edible fungus and horticultural products sharply decreased. Our results also showed that in general, impact of COVID-19 on smaller firms was more severe than that on larger firms. The results of this study can provide useful guidance and implications for agricultural businesses and policy makers on their COVID-19 mitigation efforts to navigate this global pandemic. © 2020 CAAS.

M.; Le, S.; Yang, Y.; Zhang, B.; Yao, W.; Gao, Z.; Cheng, S.","BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created challenges that have caused profound changes in health behaviors. This study aimed to explore how COVID-19 is affecting the health-related quality of life (QoL) among Chinese adults. METHODS: The data of health-related behaviors and QoL were collected via online surveys from 2289 adults (mean age = 27.8 ± 12 years) who had been isolated at home for an average of 77 days. RESULTS: More than 50% of the respondents reported that their time engaged in daily physical activity (PA) decreased, while sedentary behavior (SB) time increased compared with that before the lockdown. Only 20% of the respondents reported engaging in moderate-to-vigorous PA, 23% of adults reported changed their diets to be healthier, and 30% reported consuming more vegetables, fruits, and milk products than before home-isolation. During home-isolation, 75.2% of the adults rated their sleep quality as very good, and 65% reported that they were satisfied with their QoL. Sleep quality mediated the relationship between PA and QoL. CONCLUSION: The two-to-three-month home-isolation has had mixed effects on adult health behaviors in China. The participants were found to have focused more on their eating quality and patterns, which had a positive influence on their QoL. However, people should be encouraged to exercise at home with limited space to maintain a generally healthy lifestyle during a prolonged quarantine.",2020,"Int J Environ Res Public Health","17","15","",32748825,"10.3390/ijerph17155575","Asia"
"63","Impact of COVID-19 on China's macroeconomy and agri-food system – an economy-wide multiplier model analysis","Zhang, Yumei; Diao, Xinshen; Chen, Kevin Z.; Robinson, Sherman; Fan, Shenggen","Purpose: The purpose of this study is to assess the potential economic cost of the COVID-19 pandemic on China's macroeconomy and agri-food system and provide policy recommendations to stimulate economic growth and agri-food system development. Design/methodology/approach: An economy-wide multisector multiplier model built on China's most recent social accounting matrix (SAM) for 2017 with 149 economic sectors is used to assess the impact of COVID-19 on China's macroeconomy and agri-food system. SAM multiplier analysis focuses on supply chain linkages and captures the complexity of an interconnected economy. Findings: The paper finds that both the macroeconomy and agri-food systems are hit significantly by COVID-19. There are three main findings. First, affected by COVID-19, GDP decreased by 6.8% in the first quarter of 2020 compared with that in 2019, while the economic loss of the agri-food system is equivalent to 7% of its value added (about RMB 0.26 trillion). More than 46m agri-food system workers (about 27% of total employment) lost their jobs to COVID-19 in the lockdown phase. The COVID-19 affects the employment of unskilled labor more than that of skilled labor. Second, when the economy starts to recover during the second and third quarters, the growth rate in the value added of the agri-food system turns positive but still modest. Many jobs resume during the period, but the level of agri-food system employment continues to be lower than the base. The agri-food system employment recovery is slower than that of other sectors largely due to the sluggish recovery of restaurants. Agri-food system employment drops by 8.6m, which accounts for about 33% of the total jobs lost. Third, although the domestic economy is expected to be normal in the fourth quarter, external demand still faces uncertainties due to the global pandemic. The agri-food system is projected to grow by 1.1% annually in 2020 with resuming export demand, while only by 0.4% without resuming export demand. These rates are much lower than an annual growth rate of 4.3% for the agri-food system in 2019. The results also show that, without resuming export demand, China's total economy will grow less than 1% in 2020, while, with export demand resumed, the growth rate rises to 1.7%. These rates are much lower than an annual GDP growth rate of 6.1% in 2019. Practical implications: The results show that continuously reducing economic dependency on exports and stimulating domestic demand are key areas that require policy support. The agri-food system can play an important role in supporting broad economic growth and job creation as SMEs are major part of the AFS. Job creation requires policies to promote innovation by entrepreneurs who run numerous SMEs in China. Originality/value: This paper represents the first systematic study assessing the impact of COVID-19 on China's agri-food system in terms of value added and employment. The assessment considers three phases of lockdown, recovery and normal phases in order to capture the full potential cost of COVID-19. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

"64","Impact of COVID-19 on China's agricultural trade","Cao, Lijuan; Li, Tianxiang; Wang, Rongbo; Zhu, Jing","Purpose: The outbreak of the novel COVID-19 virus has spread throughout the world, causing unprecedented disruption to not only China's agricultural trade but also the world's agricultural trade at large. This paper attempts to provide a preliminary analysis of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on China's agricultural importing and exporting from both short- and long-term perspectives. Design/methodology/approach: This study seeks to analyze how the outbreak of COVID-19 could potentially impact China's agricultural trade. With respect to exports, the authors have pinpointed major disruptive factors arising from the pandemic which have affected China's agricultural exports in both the short and long term; in doing so, we employ scenario analysis which simulates potential long-term effects. With regard to imports, possible impacts of the pandemic regarding the prospects of food availability in the world market are investigated. Using scenario analysis, the authors estimate the potential change in China's food market—especially meat import growth—in light of the implementation of the newly signed Sino-US Economic and Trade Agreement (SUETA). Findings: The results show that China's agricultural exports have been negatively impacted in the short-term, mostly due to the disruption of the supply chain. In the long term, dampened external demand and potential imposition of non-tariff trade barriers (NTBs) will exert more profound and lasting negative effects on China's agricultural export trade. On the other hand, despite panic buying and embargoing policies from some exporting and importing countries, the world food availability and China's food import demand are still optimistic. The simulation results indicate that China's import of pork products, in light of COVID-19 and the implementation of SUETA, would most likely see a sizable climb in quantity, but a lesser climb in terms of value. Originality/value: Agricultural trade in China has been a focal-point of attention in recent years, with new challenges slowing exports and increasing dependence on imports for food security. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic adds significant uncertainty to agricultural trade, giving rise to serious concerns regarding its potential impact. By exploring the impact of the unprecedented pandemic on China's agricultural trade, this study should contribute to a better understanding of the still-evolving pandemic and shed light on pertinent policy implications.

This paper discusses the impact of COVID-19 on agricultural production in China, followed by government responses to alleviate the negative effects. The results show that unreasonable restrictions would block the outflow channels of agricultural products, hinder necessary production inputs, destroy production cycles, and finally undermine production capacity.

We argue that fundamental revolution in China's livestock system can meet about 50% of its consumption of livestock products and thereby reduce the country's reliance on imports. Three food system revolutions that can greatly reduce China's reliance on imports are technically and economically feasible, and generate high eco-system benefits: (1) organic or inorganic based microbial feed protein production to substitute imported feed protein, (2) vegetation greening and fodder production through grassland restoration to reduce import of ruminant animal products, and (3) insect protein based fish-plant production and offshore marine restoration to replace red meat consumption and increase recycling of manure.

Local management of food security has received little attention. PURPOSE: This paper describes emergency food policies in Wuhan and Nanjing, China during lockdown in 2020 and their implications for household food security in the two cities. METHODS AND APPROACH: Policy documents and background data describe the emergency measures. Online surveys of residents of two Chinese cities were used to gauge household food security. FINDINGS: Despite the determined efforts of provincial and city governments to ensure that food reached people who were locked down in Wuhan, or subject to restrictions on movement in Nanjing, households experienced some decline in food security. Most households found they could not access their preferred foods. But a minority of households did not get enough to eat.Government had contingency plans for the pandemic that ensured that most people had sufficient, if not preferred, food. But not all households were fully covered. POLICY IMPLICATIONS: A more resilient system of food distribution is needed, including a relatively closed and independent home delivery system. Grassroots organizations such as residential community committees, property management organizations, and spontaneous volunteer groups need to be brought into the management of emergency food provision.",2021,"Dev Policy Rev","","","",34548764,"10.1111/dpr.12575","Asia"

The fishery is a traditional and vast industry in China. The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has also exposed potential problems in China's fishery development, such as the lack of specialised aquatic product quality and safety supervision and testing institutions. New problems have also arisen, such as the decline in the market demand for fish and aquatic products, affecting fishers' income, livelihood and so on. These deficiencies require China to establish a matching legal system to correspondingly solve the current legal and political problems. This paper will systematically discuss the impact of the COVID-19 on China's fisheries sector from the perspectives of 'fishers' and 'aquatic products' after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and analyse how to deal with various problems by referring to relevant experience in light of China's national conditions and characteristics.",2022,"Ocean Coast Manag","216","","105975",34840439,"10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.105975","Asia"

It shows that while exercising symbolic power is at the core of such activities, the effectiveness of symbolic power depends on the networking/distributing power of hub nodes and associational power of the maritime community to help generate visibility. The hub nodes, however, are subject to tight control in China, and as such, their ability to deploy networking/distributing power is constrained. This suggests that worker power is conditioned by sociopolitical factors. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

This survey-based study investigated how household food related matters such as food sourcing and consumption behaviors of 2,126 Chinese consumers in different age groups changed approximately two months into the COVID-19 quarantine. A new food sourcing mechanism, community-based online group grocery-ordering (CoGGO), was widely adopted by households, particularly among the youngest group studied (18-24 years of age). The same group showed a higher confidence in the food supply system during the quarantine and a greater propensity for weight gain while staying-at-home. The more mature age group (≥35 years of age) showed heightened vigilance and awareness, with fewer grocery-shopping trips, a higher tendency for purchasing extra food, and less tendency to waste food. Survey findings of the new food-sourcing mechanism, attitudes to food, and changes in behavior among different age groups provide valuable insights to guide policies and management interventions to address matters pertaining to food supply and distribution, food access and household food security, and food waste reduction.",2021,"PLoS ONE","16","12","e0260244",34919561,"10.1371/journal.pone.0260244","Asia"

Little temporal variation in DBP concentrations suggested intensified disinfection during the COVID-19 pandemic had limited impacts on the occurrence of DBPs in the aquatic environment. In contrast, the pandemic led to a significant increase in concentrations of lopinavir and ritonavir in wastewater effluents and surface water. The high detection frequency of these pharmaceuticals in surface water after the lockdown highlighted their mobility and persistence in the aquatic environment. The initial ecological risk assessment indicated moderate risks associated with these pharmaceuticals in surface water.

F.; Wang, Y.; Shi, Z.","Aims: To identify dietary patterns during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to examine their association with changes in weight status in the Chinese population. Methods: The 2020 China COVID-19 cross-sectional survey is an anonymous 74-item survey administered via social media across 31 provinces in mainland China between April and May 2020. Dietary data were assessed by a Food Frequency Questionnaire and the changes in weight status were self-reported. Exploratory factor analysis using the principal component analysis method was applied to identify dietary patterns. The multinomial regression models were conducted, and forest plots were used to present the associations between dietary patterns and changes in weight status. Results: Of a total of 10,545 adults (aged ≥18 years), more than half of participants reported to have weight gain, with 18.6% of men and 16.3% of women having weight gain >2.5 kg. Approximately 8% of participants reported to have weight loss, with 2.1% of men and 2.5% women having weight loss >2.5 kg. Two dietary patterns, namely, the modern and prudent dietary patterns, were identified during the COVID-19 pandemic. The modern dietary pattern was loaded heavily with soft drinks, fried foods, pickles, and inversely with fresh vegetables. The prudent dietary pattern was characterized by high intake of fresh fruits, vegetables, and inversely with soft drinks and fried food. The modern dietary pattern was positively associated with weight gain in men and women, while the prudent dietary pattern was negatively associated with both weight gain and loss in men and women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: Dietary patterns during COVID-19 are significantly associated with the changes in weight status, which may subsequently increase the risk of diet-related non-communicable disease among the Chinese population.",2021,"Front Public Health","9","","709535",34966710,"10.3389/fpubh.2021.709535","Asia"

Disinfectants and disinfection by-products (DBPs) enter rivers through urban drainage and surface runoff. We investigated the variations in residual chlorine, DBPs, and different aquatic organisms in the Hanjiang, Fuhe, and Qinglinghe Rivers in Wuhan during the COVID-19 pandemic. The sampling sites were from the wastewater treatment plant outlets to the downstream drinking water treatment plant intakes. Total residual chlorine and DBPs (dichloromethane and trichloromethane) detected in the river water ranged from 0 to 0.84 mg/L and 0 to 0.034 mg/L, respectively. The residual chlorine and DBPs showed a gradual reduction pattern related to water flow, and the concentration at intakes did not exceed the Chinese drinking water source quality standards. Phytoplankton and zooplankton densities were not significantly correlated with residual chlorine and DBPs. The fluctuations in phytoplankton resource use efficiency (RUE) and zooplankton RUE in the Fuhe River, with the highest residual chlorine, and the Qinglinghe River with the highest DBPs, were higher than those in the Hanjiang River. For benthic macroinvertebrates, the number of functional feeding groups in the Hanjiang River was higher than that in the Fuhe and Qinglinghe Rivers. The water and sediment bacterial communities in the Hanjiang River differed significantly from those in the Fuhe and Qingling Rivers. The denitrification function involved in N metabolism was stronger in the Fuhe and Qinglinghe Rivers. Structural equation modelling revealed that residual chlorine and DBPs impacted the diversity of benthos through direct and indirect effects on plankton. Although large-scale chlorine-containing disinfectants use occurred during the investigation, it did not harm the density of the detected aquatic organisms in water sources. With the regular use of chlorinated disinfectants for indoor and outdoor environments in response to the SARS-CoV-2 globally, it is still necessary to study the long-term and accumulated responses of water ecosystems exposed to chlorine-containing disinfectants.",2021,"Sci Total Environ","","","151711",34800457,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.151711","Asia"

Our empirical analysis is based on a survey of 655 salmon consumers in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai. We estimate that the purchase intention recovery period lasts 21 weeks among the surveyed consumers after the shock. Although the epidemic risk levels of the three cities are different, there is a significant difference only in the recovery period from 5 to 7th weeks. The Cox proportional hazards model results further show that consumers with less risk-averse are more active in resuming purchase intention, and the effect of risk perception is just the opposite. Moreover, risk perception has a moderating effect on risk preference and recovery period. Finally, we put forward three possible policy implications: attaching nucleic acid detection certificate, strengthening cold chain management, and diversifying cooking methods. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2021,"Aquaculture Economics and Management","","","",NA,"10.1080/13657305.2021.2019353","Asia"

People in China have gradually returned to normal life; however, in the protracted pandemic, people may still follow certain dietary behaviors to cope with COVID-19. This study was the second stage of a longitudinal nutritional survey conducted in post-lockdown China that was aimed at exploring post-lockdown dietary behaviors and their effects on dietary diversity. In line with the first stage of the survey, the current dietary behaviors used to cope with COVID-19 and ways of purchasing food were determined. In addition, changes in dietary behavior compared to the same period in 2019 and those behaviors recommended to ensure food safety were also investigated. The Household Dietary Diversity Score (HDDS) was used to assess dietary diversity; this was also used in the first stage of the survey. Linear regression was used to model the associations between the HDDS, participants' characteristics, and dietary behaviors. The data of 1994 participants were included in the analysis. The overall mean HDDS was 9.2 ± 2.0. Compared to the same period in 2019, a substantial proportion of participants self-reported that they had recently decreased eating in restaurants (61.6%) and reduced intakes of seafood (53.1%), imported frozen food (57.1%), and raw food (60.5%), while 64.8% of participants reported increased cooking at home. People with an increased consumption of seafood (adjusted OR (95%CI) = 0.56 (0.07, 1.04)) and raw food (adjusted OR (95%CI) = 0.74 (0.27, 1.21)) had a significantly higher HDDS. Participants who changed their consumption of imported frozen food (both increased and decreased) had a higher HDDS (adjusted OR (95%CI) = 0.56 (0.07, 1.04) and 0.27 (0.09, 0.44), respectively). People who depended more on purchasing food online had a significantly higher HDDS (adjusted OR (95%CI) = 0.29 (0.02, 0.55)). Compared to the data from stage 1, the proportion of people choosing healthy products to cope with COVID-19 did not greatly change and those people had a higher HDDS (adjusted OR (95%CI) = 0.31 (0.19, 0.42)). Although this study found that the proportion of people who chose to use alcohol or vinegar to prevent COVID-19 had decreased substantially compared to during lockdown, there were still 5.3% and 9.8% who followed these irrational behaviors. Regarding the dietary behavior regarding food safety, except for cooking food fully, fewer than half of participants followed the recommended dietary behaviors, including individual food servings (44.2%), using serving chopsticks and spoons (44.8%), and preparing raw and cooked food separately (43.3%). People who followed these behaviors had a better dietary diversity. In conclusion, during the post-lockdown period, people still followed certain dietary behaviors to cope with COVID-19. While some dietary behaviors were adopted to help prevent infection, irrational dietary behaviors were still followed.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was conducted through online questionnaire. We collected data on food and nutrition related concerns, socio-demographic characteristics, and changes in dietary behaviors. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2267 responses were received from people living in 31 provinces across mainland China and 1994 participants were included in the final analysis. ANALYSIS: Linear and multinomial logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association among food and nutrition related concerns, socio-demographic factors, and dietary behaviors Results: About 56% of participants reported moderate to high levels of concerns related to food and nutrition. Contracting the virus when dining out or through contaminated foods were the top two concerns, followed by overnutrition. Higher levels of concerns were found among people who were older, overweight, or obese, having lower income and education, and living in urban areas, or whose family contained vulnerable individuals. Compared with the pre-COVID-19 period, people who were more concerned about food and nutrition were more likely to report changes in their food purchases and consumption; they were also more likely to eat from individual plates, using serving chopsticks, and separating plates and utensils for raw and cooked foods during the post COVID-19 lockdown period.

We used paired t-tests or χ(2) tests to evaluate the significance of differences in consumption patterns of 12 major food groups and beverages across educational levels, between sexes, and before and after COVID-19 lockdown. During the COVID-19 lockdown, significant decreases were observed in the frequency of intake of rice, meat, poultry, fresh vegetables, fresh fruit, soybean products, and dairy products, with significant sex differences (females consuming more rice, fresh vegetables and fruit and less meat, poultry, soybean and dairy products than males). Significant increases were observed in the frequency of consumption of wheat products, other staple foods, and preserved vegetables, with males consuming these foods more frequently than females. Graduate students consumed most foods more frequently except rice and other staple foods and preserved vegetables. The frequency of sugar-sweetened beverage consumption had decreased while frequency of tea drinking had increased. The participating youths' diet patterns had significantly changed during the COVID-19 lockdown, with heterogeneities observed to different extents between sexes and across educational levels.

"82","The Case for Healthy U.S.‐China Agricultural Trade Relations despite Deglobalization Pressures","Zhang, Wendong","The COVID‐19 pandemic is crippling the global economy and heightening distrust and political disagreements among major countries. Furthermore, ongoing deglobalization efforts taken by firms and countries are fueling the rise of economic nationalism. A prime example is the possible decoupling of US–China economic and trade relations, which the ongoing trade war has already significantly disrupted. This paper analyzes the impacts of COVID‐19 on US agricultural exports to China, especially the added delays and uncertainty regarding China's food imports meeting the US–China phase one trade deal target. I present the views of US farmers and the general public toward China and argue that healthy US–China agricultural trade relations are not only critical for both countries but welcomed by US farmers. I also discuss the possible rise in nontariff barriers following the pandemic as well as trade policies that are increasingly intertwined with political tensions. Finally, I discuss how the US–China phase one trade deal could possibly lead to a more balanced bilateral agricultural trade portfolio with greater share of protein and retail food products.

"83","Has the COVID-19 pandemic affected maritime connectivity? An estimation for China and the polar silk road countries","Tianming, G.; Erokhin, V.; Arskiy, A.; Khudzhatov, M.","In light of about 80% of international freight traffic carried by sea, maritime supply chains’ stability is pivotal to global connectivity. For over a year now, the transboundary mobility of vessels and cargoes has been restricted by diverse forms of the COVID-19 containment measures applied by national governments, while the lockdowns of people, businesses, and economic activities have significantly affected the growth prospects of various maritime connectivity initiatives. This study investigates how the pandemic-related public health, trade, and market factors have shifted the connectivity patterns in the Polar Silk Road (PSR) transport corridor between China, South Korea, Japan, Russia, and four economies of Northern Europe. The causality links between the Shipping Connectivity Index (SCI) and the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, trade volumes with China and the rest of the world, and price indexes of minerals, fuels, food, and agricultural products are revealed separately for eight countries and thirty-five ports. The study algorithm is built on the consecutive application of the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) and the Phillips-Perron (PP) stationarity tests, the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) method, the Fully-Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS) and the Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) robustness checks, and the Toda-Yamamoto causality test. Tight trade-connectivity links are recorded in all locations along the China-PSR transport corridor in 2015-2019, but in 2020, the relationships weakened. Bidirectional influences between the number of COVID-19 cases and connectivity parameters demonstrate the maritime sector’s sensitivity to safety regulations and bring into focus the role of cargo shipping in the transboundary spread of the virus. The authors’ four-stage approach contributes to the establishment of a methodology framework that may equip stakeholders with insights about potential risks to maritime connectivity in the China-PSR maritime trade in the course of the pandemic. © 2021 by the authors.

E.; Correia, A.; Wen, J.; Kozak, M.","In light of COVID-19's effects on individuals' social, economic, political, and psychological values, this paper aims to investigate the pandemic's role in possible changes to people's food consumption and meal habits in three countries, namely China, Portugal, and Turkey. The sample includes individuals from the three countries, exploratory factor analysis and non-parametric tests were used to test the differences. Results suggest that coronavirus has played a strong part in altering households' food consumption and meal habits within these countries. The pandemic has particularly led to greater consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables and spending more time eating meals at home. Portugal appears to be consuming more seafood, bread, and butter whereas China features higher consumption of rice and meat products; Turkey is consuming more meat and eggs.

Limited previous global fishing effort analyses, based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data (2017–2020), suggest economic and environmental factors have less influence on fisheries than cultural and political events, such as holidays and closures, respectively. As such, restrictions from COVID-19 during 2020 provided an unprecedented opportunity to explore added impacts from COVID-19 restrictions on fishing effort. We analyzed global fishing effort and fishing gear changes (2017–2019) for policy and cultural impacts, and then compared impacts of COVID-19 lockdowns across several countries (i.e., China, Spain, the US, and Japan) in 2020. Our findings showed global fishing effort increased from 2017 to 2019 but decreased by 5.2% in 2020. We found policy had a greater impact on monthly global fishing effort than culture, with Chinese longlines decreasing annually. During the lockdown in 2020, trawling activities dropped sharply, particularly in the coastal areas of China and Spain. Although Japan did not implement an official lockdown, its fishing effort in the coastal areas also decreased sharply. In contrast, fishing in the Gulf of Mexico, not subject to lockdown, reduced its scope of fishing activities, but fishing effort was higher. Our study demonstrates, by including the dimensions of policy and culture in fisheries, that large data may materially assist decision-makers to understand factors influencing fisheries’ efforts, and encourage further marine interdisciplinary research. We recommend the lack of data for small-scale Southeast Asian fisheries be addressed to enable future studies of fishing drivers and impacts in this region. © 2021 by the authors.

Although Dietary lifestyle includes attitudes and behaviors to meet their most basic needs, but few studies have examined the pattern of changes in dietary lifestyle driven by COVID-19. This study explores changes in dietary attitudes and behaviors among Korean consumers after COVID-19. SUBJECTS/METHODS: An online survey was conducted with 549 Korean adults aged 20 and older to identify general demographics and changes in dietary attitudes and behaviors. Data were collected from Oct 12 to Oct 18, 2020. Frequency, percentage, and mean values were calculated and a K-means cluster analysis was performed to categorize consumers based on the 5S of dietary attitudes (i.e., savor-oriented, safety-oriented, sustainability-oriented, saving-oriented, and socializing-oriented). RESULTS: Findings indicate consumers considered safety, health, and freshness to be most important when choosing groceries and prepared meal such as home meal replacement and delivery food. Among the types of services, a large proportion of consumers increased their delivery and take-out services. Regarding retail channels, the increase in the use of online retailers was remarkable compared to offline retailers. Finally, consumers were classified into four segments based on changes in dietary attitudes: ""most influenced,"" ""seeking safety and sustainability,"" ""abstaining from savor and socializing,"" and ""least influenced."" Each type of consumer exhibited statistically significant differences by sex, age, household composition, presence of disease, and perceived risk of COVID-19.

To effectively contain its impacts, a nation-wide temporary lockdown was enforced in India. The resultant panic buying and stockpiling incidents together with spread of misinformation created a sense of food insecurity at local level. This paper discusses a specific case of Nagpur from the worst affected Maharashtra state of India, wherein the urban-rural food supply chains were reportedly disrupted. Based on formal interviews with local government officials, a month-long timeline of COVID-19 outbreak in Nagpur was studied along with the consequent government initiatives for maintaining public health and food supply. While the city residents were confined to their homes, this study then assessed their perceived food security at household level, along with their ""Immediate Concerns"" and ""Key Information Sources"". Through online surveys at two different time intervals, the concerns of ""Food and Grocery"" were found to be rising, and ""Government Apps and Websites"" were identified as the most reliable source of information.

It was reported that the water quality of the Ganga River has improved as compared to regular during this country-wide lockdown. In the present study, an attempt has been made to study the change in water quality of the river in terms of turbidity purely through remote sensing data, in the absence of ground observations, especially during this time period. The change in spectral reflectance of water along the river in the visible region has been analyzed using the Sentinel-2 multispectral remote sensing data at Haridwar, Kanpur, Prayagraj, and Varanasi stretches of the river. In the present study, it was found that the red and NIR bands are most sensitive, and can be used to estimate the turbidity. Further, the temporal variation in turbidity was also analyzed through normalized difference turbidity index at each location. It was observed that the turbidity in the river has reduced drastically at each stretch of the river. The study elicited that the remote sensing approach can be used to make qualitative estimates on turbidity, even in the absence of field observations. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

"92","Impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on the economic situation and food security of rural households in India","Suresh, V.; Fishman, R.; von Lieres, J. S.; Rao, B. R.","Purpose: The purpose of the study is to understand what impact the first COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 had on the income and food security of rural households in India and whether it differed across socioeconomic factors. Moreover, the study assesses the needs of rural households and determines whether they had received adequate support services during the lockdown. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopted a repeated-measures quantitative survey design with 1,319 rural women from 16 states of India and conducted a telephonic survey. Findings: The lockdown had directly impacted rural households' employment status and income but the impact differed depending on the type of employment. For example, working in a salaried job or on one's farm led to a lower likelihood of a complete decline in income in states other than Kerala as the lockdown continued. The study also revealed a change in the pattern of food consumption, with higher consumption of subsidized staple foods. It also became evident that the aid announced by the government reached the rural population with some delay. Research limitations/implications: A limitation of the study was that many respondents refused to participate in phase 2, which reduced the sample size when comparing the two phases because the women did not own mobile phones. Instead, they were using their husbands' phones. Originality/value: The study's findings can help better understand the needs of rural populations during crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This can help to plan better and build preventive actions for such populations once their needs are understood. In addition, this can aid disadvantaged people for a minimal level of preparedness and security during such a crisis in the future. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2022,"Journal of Agribusiness in Developing and Emerging Economies","","","",NA,"10.1108/JADEE-07-2021-0177","Asia"

D.; Escobar-Alegria, J.; Avula, R.; Menon, P.","OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has profound negative impacts on people's lives, but little is known on its effect on household food insecurity (HFI) in poor setting resources. This study assessed changes in HFI during the pandemic and examined the interlinkages between HFI with child feeding practices and coping strategies. DESIGN: A longitudinal survey in December 2019 (in-person) and August 2020 (by phone). SETTING: Community-based individuals from 26 blocks in 2 districts in Uttar Pradesh, India. PARTICIPANTS: Mothers with children <2 years (n=569). MAIN OUTCOMES AND ANALYSES: We measured HFI by using the HFI Access Scale and examined the changes in HFI during the pandemic using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank tests. We then assessed child feeding practices and coping strategies by HFI status using multivariable regression models. RESULTS: HFI increased sharply from 21% in December 2019 to 80% in August 2020, with 62% households changing the status from food secure to insecure over this period. Children in newly or consistently food-insecure households were less likely to consume a diverse diet (adjusted OR, AOR 0.57, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.95 and AOR 0.51, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.12, respectively) compared with those in food-secure households. Households with consistent food insecurity were more likely to engage in coping strategies such as reducing other essential non-food expenditures (AOR 2.2, 95% CI 1.09 to 4.24), borrowing money to buy food (AOR 4.3, 95% CI 2.31 to 7.95) or selling jewellery (AOR 5.0, 95% CI 1.74 to 14.27) to obtain foods. Similar findings were observed for newly food-insecure households. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic and its lockdown measures posed a significant risk to HFI which in turn had implications for child feeding practices and coping strategies. Our findings highlight the need for further investment in targeted social protection strategies and safety nets as part of multisectoral solutions to improve HFI during and after COVID-19.",2021,"BMJ Open","11","4","e048738",33883156,"10.1136/bmjopen-2021-048738","Asia"

The outbreak in India has resulted in emergency lockdown in the country for more than 2 months, and that caused decline in the catch, demand, and supply of fish. It has severely altered the life and livelihoods of the floodplain wetland fishers. These floodplain wetlands play a key role in socio-economic development of stakeholders, by generating employment and livelihood in the studied regions. In the present study, a systematic assessment was conducted to identify the impact of lockdown on floodplain wetland fisheries in India with the aim to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on wetland fishing, fisheries production, income, and food access. We conducted a rapid telephonic survey covering176 wetland fishers in 3 states to document the early impacts of the pandemic and policy responses on floodplain wetland fisher households. The majority of fishers report negative impacts on production, sales, and incomes. Fishers of three Indian states Bihar, West Bengal, and Assam lost 20, 25, and 9 fishing days, respectively. About 70, 60, and 55 % fishers of floodplain wetlands of the three states admitted that lockdown made them partially jobless. Fish harvest during March to May was 32, 44, and 20 % lower than the previous years in Bihar, West Bengal, and Assam. The fishers of Bihar, West Bengal, and Assam lost income of INR 10000/-, 12500/-, and 4500/- due to lockdown. The analysis also showed that 25% of fishers each responded moderate to severe psychological impact and anxiety symptoms due to COVID-19. Demand supply gap during the lockdown led to the in 20-40 % increase in farm gate price of fishes at the wetland level.

Here, a total of 33 water samples have been collected in the pre-lockdown, lockdown, and unlock phases. The results showed that decreasing trend of the microbial load was found in the lockdown phase. Heavy metal pollution index (HPI) illustrated that all samples are highly polluted (HPI > 150) during the pre-lockdown phase, while during the lockdown phase; HPI showed that around 54.54% of samples have been positively changed (low pollution level). During the unlock phase, 45.45% of samples were again amplified to the high pollution level. Pearson’s correlation coefficient and hierarchical cluster analysis indicated strong relation among heavy metals with faecal coliform at a 0.05% level of significance.

M.","The end of the current decade experienced an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus classified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) [coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)] that spread across the globe within a short span of time and was declared as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. In order to contain the spread of COVID-19, the Indian Government imposed lockdown in various phases, namely, the strict lockdown period (SLP) and relaxed lockdown period (RLP). The present study addresses changes in the magnitude of satellite-derived water quality parameters in the coastal waters off major Indian cities (Mumbai and Chennai) and river basins (Narmada, Mandovi-Zuari, Netravathi, Periyar, Kaveri, Krishna-Godavari, Mahanadi, and Hooghly) along the eastern Arabian Sea (EAS) and western Bay of Bengal (WBoB) during SLP and RLP. The daily climatology (2003–2019) and anomaly (2020) of different water quality parameters, viz., chlorophyll-a (chl-a), downwelling diffused attenuation coefficient (kd490), and particulate organic carbon (POC) were used in the present study to eliminate seasonal biases and to unravel the signature of lockdown-induced changes in the magnitude of the above water quality parameters. During the total lockdown period, the magnitude of the above parameters reduced significantly in the coastal waters of both the EAS and the WBoB. However, this reduction was more significant in the coastal waters of the WBoB, attributed to a reduction in the supply of anthropogenic nutrients. Among different studied locations, the magnitude of water quality parameters significantly decreased off Chennai and Hooghly, during SLP, which subsequently increased during RLP probably due to reduction in anthropogenic material influx during SLP and increase during RLP. During RLP, the coastal waters off Mahanadi showed a maximum decrease in the magnitude of water quality parameters followed by Mandovi-Zuari, irrespective of these regions’ quantum of anthropogenic material input, possibly due to the higher response time of the ecosystem to reflect the reduction in anthropogenic perturbations. The satellite-retrieved water quality parameters have provided valuable insight to efficiently describe the changes in the health of the Indian coastal environment in terms of phytoplankton biomass and water clarity. © Copyright © 2021 Lotliker, Baliarsingh, Shesu, Samanta, Naik and Balakrishnan Nair.",2021,"Frontiers in Marine Science","8","","",NA,"10.3389/fmars.2021.648166","Asia"

W.; Sathyendranath, S.","The United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goal Life Below Water (SDG-14) aims to “conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development”. Within SDG-14, targets 14.1 and 14.2 deal with marine pollution and the adverse impacts of human activities on aquatic systems. Here, we present a remote-sensing-based analysis of short-term changes in the Vembanad-Kol wetland system in the southwest of India. The region has experienced high levels of anthropogenic pressures, including from agriculture, industry, and tourism, leading to adverse ecological and socioeconomic impacts with consequences not only for achieving the targets set out in SDG-14, but also those related to water quality (SDG-6) and health (SDG-3). To move towards the sustainable management of coastal and aquatic ecosystems such as Lake Vembanad, it is important to understand how both natural and anthropogenic processes affect water quality. In 2020, a unique opportunity arose to study water quality in Lake Vembanad during a period when anthropogenic pressures were reduced due to a nationwide lockdown in response to the global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 (25 March–31 May 2020). Using Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 multi-spectral remote sensing and in situ observations to analyse changes in five different water quality indicators, we show that water quality improved in large areas of Lake Vembanad during the lockdown in 2020, especially in the more central and southern regions, as evidenced by a decrease in total suspended matter, turbidity, and the absorption by coloured dissolved organic matter, all leading to clearer waters as indicated by the Forel-Ule classification of water colour. Further analysis of longer term trends (2013–2020) showed that water quality has been improving over time in the more northern regions of Lake Vembanad independent of the lockdown. The improvement in water quality during the lockdown in April–May 2020 illustrates the importance of addressing anthropogenic activities for the sustainable management of coastal ecosystems and water resources. © 2021 by the authors.

P.; Bera, B.; Sengupta, D.; Bhunia, G. S.; Shit, P. K.","The sudden lockdown recovers the health of the total environment particularly air and water while the country's economic growth and socio-cultural tempo of people have been completely hampered due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of the industries within the catchment area of river Damodar have been closed; as a result, significant changes have been reflected throughout the stretch of river Damodar. The main objective of the study is to analyze the impact of lockdown on the water quality of river Damodar. A total of 55 samples was collected from eleven different confluence sites of nallas with the main river channel during and pre-lockdown period. The relevant methods like WQI, TSI, Pearson's correlation coefficient, and ""t"" test have been applied to evaluate the physical, chemical, and biological status of river water. The result of ""t"" test indicated that there are significant differences (α = 0.05) of each parameter between pre and during lockdown. Water quality index (WQI) is used for analysis of drinking water quality suitability followed by BIS. The values of WQI showed ""very poor"" (S1, S2, S3, S6, S7, and S11) to ""unfit for drinking"" (S4, S5, S8, S9, and S10) of river water during pre-monsoon season. The nutrient enrichment status of the river was analyzed by Trophic State Index (TSI) method and it shows the ""High"" eutrophic condition with a heavy concentration of algal blooms in almost an entire stretch. During lockdown, nutrient supplies like TN and TP have been reduced and is designated as ""Low"" (S1, S2) to ""Moderate"" (S3 to S11) eutrophic condition of middle stretch of Damodar.

The ample research on fitness of environment has been proved that the strict imposition of lockdown was the blessings of environment. The river Damodar has historical significance and lifeline for huge population of Jharkhand and West Bengal state of India but in the recent years the water quality has been deteriorated due to untreated industrial effluents and urban sewage. The main objective of this study is to examine the water quality of river Damodar during and prelockdown phase for domestic use and restoration of river ecosystem. A total of eleven (11) effluent discharge sites were selected in prelockdown and during lockdown phase. A new approach of water quality assessment, i.e., water pollution index (WPI) has been applied in this study. WPI is weightage free, unbiased method to analysis of water quality. The result shows that the physical, chemical and heavy elements were found beyond the standard limit in prelockdown period. The cation and anion were arranged in an order of Na2+ > K+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ and Cl− > So4− > No3− > F− in both the sessions. WPI of prelockdown showed that about 100% water samples are of highly polluted. WPI of lockdown period showed that around 90.90% samples improved to 'good quality' and 9.10% of samples are of 'moderately polluted.' Hypothesis testing by 't' test proved that there was a significant difference (ρ = 0.05%) in values of each parameter between two periods. Null hypothesis was rejected and indicated the improvement of river water quality statistically. Spatial mapping using Arc GIS 10.4 interpolation (IDW) helps to understand spatial intensity of pollution load in two periods. This research study should be helpful for further management and spatial diagnosis of water resource of river Damodar. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

"105","Agri-food supply chain and disruptions due to COVID-19: effects and strategies","Sid, Saurabh; Mor, Rahul S.; Panghal, Anupama; Kumar, Dinesh; Gahlawat, Vijay Kumar","Goal: The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has severely affected the global economies. It has a considerable effect on the agri-food economy and the linking food supply chains. The entire agrifood sector needs more attention because the concept of 'work from home' does not work here, and life cannot move even a single step without food. This paper offers a future agri-food sector perspective amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Design / Methodology / Approach: This paper explores the short-term and long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on agri-food supply chains (AFSCs) based on the available information. The regulatory mechanisms taken by different government agencies, NGOs, and the food industry to manage the demand & supply disruptions are also discussed. Results: The detailed effect analysis of the COVID-19 on agri-food supply chains and remedial strategies are conducted for different interfaces of AFSC, viz. production, handling & storage, processing & packaging, distribution & marketing, consumption, etc. Limitations of the investigation: Given the research area's novelty, it may take enormous time to fully assess the current pandemic (COVID-19) effect on agri-food and its allied sectors. Practical implications: This paper would help the agri-food industry and the authorities assess the effect of COVID-19 on the agri-food sector. Originality/Value: This paper significantly contributes to new research directions and views for the AFSC and disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

"106","From Farm to Fork: Early Impacts of COVID-19 on Food Supply Chain","Vyas, S.; Chanana, N.; Chanana, M.; Aggarwal, P. K.","COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in widespread global disruptions. While much is being discussed about the health and economic impacts, there has been a limited focus on the immediate food sector shocks and their related social implications in developing countries, especially when the farmer surveys cannot be conducted due to mobility restrictions in many countries. To overcome these challenges, this study uses news mining and content analysis of media articles published from February to April 2020, to assess the early impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the food supply chain and farm distress in India. It also presents the media perception of the impact of the pandemic and resulting policy measures using sentiment analysis, in addition to the cross-tabulation of results that show differential impacts across food supply chain components among different commodity groups and regions. The results show wide-scale impacts across different components of the food supply chain ranging from crop harvesting and processing, distribution and logistics to disruptions across food markets, as represented by 22, 11 and 30% of total articles, respectively. The impacts are also differentiated by commodity groups, with animal products having more trade and demand-side issues, logistic bottlenecks in fruits and vegetables and crops showing problems in labor availability and harvesting. Sentiment analysis of news items shows a spike in the negative sentiment immediately post the national lockdown, with relatively less negativity in subsequent weeks due to large-scale policy and community action. Sentiment classification along different indicators shows the highest negative sentiment for animal products (85%) in commodity groups, western states of India (78%) among different regions, and food supply (85%) and markets (83%) among supply chain components. Further, extreme weather analysis (using excess rainfall events) shows that farmers faced compound risks from the COVID-19 pandemic and extreme weather events in many parts of the country. The results highlight the importance of building resilient food systems, especially when the biotic and abiotic shocks are projected to increase globally due to many drivers including biodiversity loss and climate change. © Copyright © 2021 Vyas, Chanana, Chanana and Aggarwal.",2021,"Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems","5","","",NA,"10.3389/fsufs.2021.658290","Asia"
"107","COVID-19 and its impact on environment: Improved pollution levels during the lockdown period – A case from Ahmedabad, India","Aman, M. A.; Salman, M. S.; Yunus, A. P.","The novel Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) hit the world severely in the first half of 2020 which forced several nations to impose severe restrictions on all sorts of activities involving human population. People were mainly advised to remain home quarantined to curb the virus spread. Industrial and vehicular movements were ceased as a result of lockdown, and therefore the rate of pollutants entering the ecosystem was also reduced in many places. Water and air pollution remained a major concern in the last few decades as these were gradually deteriorating in many spheres including the hydrosphere and atmosphere. As the nation-wide lockdown period in India completed more than two months, this study attempted to analyze the impact of lockdown on water and air quality to understand the short-term environmental changes. Using remote sensing data, this study demonstrated the improvements in ambient water quality in terms of decreased turbidity levels for a section of the Sabarmati River in the Ahmedabad region of India. The Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) concentrations are evaluated to underline the turbidity levels in the study area before and during the lockdown period using the Landsat 8 OLI images. We noticed that the average SPM has significantly decreased by about 36.48% when compared with the pre-lockdown period; and a drop of 16.79% was observed from the previous year's average SPM. Overall, the average SPM concentration during the lockdown period (8.08 mg/l), was the lowest when compared with pre-lockdown average and long-term (2015–2019) April month average. The atmospheric pollution level (NO2, PM2.5, and PM10) data obtained from the Central Pollution Control Board for Ahmedabad city also shows a significant improvement during the study period, implying a positive response of COVID-19 imposed lockdown on the environmental fronts. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",2020,"Remote Sensing Applications: Society and Environment","20","","",NA,"10.1016/j.rsase.2020.100382","Asia"

"110","All pain and no gain: Factors impacting local and regional sustainability due to COVID-19 pandemic with respect to the Indian marine fisheries","Kundu, S. K.; Santhanam, H.","Monitoring frameworks under a non-disaster scenario can be helpful to identify the various socio-technical constraints of local and regional origin which influence the economics and resources management of marine fisheries. However, local-scale manifestations of regional/global changes due to the rapid onset of a disaster scenario may lead to unprecedented distortion of the market demand-supply value chains for the fisheries sector at shorter temporal scales. The global pandemic of COronaVIrus Disease (COVID-19) provided a unique short, temporal window to study the evolution of socio-economic challenges to sustainable fishing in the Bay of Bengal (BoB), India. The present study provides a detailed multi-source assessment of the factors that lead to massive complications of market disruption beginning with a public curfew on 22nd March 2020, followed by a nationwide complete lockdown of 54 days beginning from 25th March 2020, indicating an ""all-pain no-gain"" scenario for the fishers. Aggravating factors as a cessation of food services, and the restriction of exports of perishable commodities indicated negative spin-offs for allied activities sectors such as food processing due to low or negligible demand. The present investigation also indicated that as part of rehabilitation, policies related to overfishing are necessary to promote sustainable fishing practices in the BoB region in a post-pandemic period. New policy frameworks must consider the community-centric factors which facilitated the alleviation of the impacts of anthropogenic activities related to fishing and the slow restoration of the demand-supply chain, with long-term benefits for natural resources sustenance and to aid marine conservation efforts.",2021,"Curr Res Environ Sustain","3","","100086",34977607,"10.1016/j.crsust.2021.100086","Asia"

R.; Ronto, R.; Sengupta, R.; Kansal, S.; Rathi, N.","COVID-19 and its associated regulatory measures including lockdowns, curfews, and physical distancing norms have significantly affected individual's dietary and culinary behaviours. Although there is ample empirical evidence available on dietary changes within the Indian context, very limited evidence exists about the factors influencing these dietary modifications and changes in culinary behaviours during COVID-19 lockdown. Therefore, the aim of this qualitative study was to explore the views of Indian household food gatekeepers towards meal planning, food purchasing, and meal preparation during the pandemic and its associated lockdowns. A convenience sample of 34 female gatekeepers from the Mumbai metropolis participated in online interviews. Interviews were conducted in English and Hindi (then translated in English), audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Underpinned by Template Analysis technique, transcribed data were analysed manually and using the NVivo software program. The interview structure guided the development of themes. The emerging themes included were: Increased household cooking; Involvement of children and male members in food-related activities; Experimentation in the kitchen; Adoption of meal planning skills; Increase in online food shopping; Bulk buying; Shortage of food items; Reduced consumption of outside home food; Increased variety of home-cooked meals; Increase in snacking and overall food intake; Determinants of food choices; and Family meals-a new norm. In the light of these findings, developing family-focussed, web-based nutrition programs to enhance gatekeepers' and their families' food literacy including declarative and procedural nutritional knowledge would be beneficial. The importance of organisational culinary behaviours such as planning meals in advance, shopping with a food list should be promoted to prevent hoarding and subsequently reduce strain on the food supply system. With a surge in domestic cooking, low cost nutritious recipes with the use of local and seasonal produce should be emphasized promoting healthy eating among the gatekeepers and their family members. The inclusion of food studies in the school curriculum will facilitate the development of culinary skills among children and youth. Also, there is a need for further research and surveillance to strengthen understanding of sustainability of healthy culinary behaviours practiced during the pandemic.",2022,"Appetite","172","","105948",35085666,"10.1016/j.appet.2022.105948","Asia"

"115","Urban food markets and the COVID-19 lockdown in India","Narayanan, S.; Saha, S.","On March 24, 2020, the Government of India announced a 21-day national lockdown that has since been extended to May 31, 2020. The lockdown left urban food markets in disarray with severe supply bottlenecks and restrictions on doing business. At a time when food prices in India were declining consistently, supply disruptions consequent to the lockdown have reversed the trend on average. Based on an analysis of publicly available data on wholesale and retail prices for 22 commodities from 114 Centres, we find that prices have increased since the lockdown, as of August 1, 2020. There is significant diversity across commodities and geographies that mask aggregate figures. Average price increases were to the tune of over 6% for several pulses, over 3.5% for most edible oils, 15% for potato 28% for tomato in the four weeks post-lockdown compared to prices during the four weeks preceding the lockdown. Price of meat and fish too have registered large increases. Price wedge between retail and wholesale prices increased as did spatial dispersion, both signifying friction in supply chains. We find that smaller cities have seen a much higher increase in prices with some seeing a rise in retail food prices by as much as 20%. Three rounds of surveys, conducted between April and July, of food retailers in 14 Indian cities reveal serious operational challenges. These include, among others, transport and labor shortages, police harassment and social discrimination. At the same time, several innovative arrangements and adaptations have evolved as well suggesting resilience. The paper reviews these aspects and outlines some lessons for food policy in emerging economies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2021,"Global Food Security","29","","",NA,"10.1016/j.gfs.2021.100515","Asia"

N.; Kouser, A.; Kurniawan, T. A.; Phanindra, K. B. V. N.","The COVID-19 related lockdowns have brought the planet to a standstill. It has severely shrunk the global economy in the year 2020, including India. The blue economy and especially the small-scale fisheries sector in India have dwindled due to disruptions in the fish catch, market, and supply chain. This research presents the applicability of satellite data to monitor the impact of COVID-19 related lockdown on the Indian fisheries sector. Three harbors namely Mangrol, Veraval, and Vankbara situated on the north-western coast of India were selected in this study based on characteristics like harbor’s age, administrative control, and availability of cloud-free satellite images. To analyze the impact of COVID in the fisheries sector, we utilized high-resolution PlanetScope data for monitoring and comparison of “area under fishing boats” during the pre-lockdown, lockdown, and post-lockdown phases. A support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithm was used to identify the area under the boats. The classification results were complemented with socio-economic data and ground-level information for understanding the impact of the pandemic on the three sites. During the peak of the lockdown, it was found that the “area under fishing boats” near the docks and those parked on the land area increased by 483%, 189%, and 826% at Mangrol, Veraval, and Vanakbara harbor, respectively. After phase-I of lockdown, the number of parked vessels decreased, yet those already moved out to the land area were not returned until the south-west monsoon was over. A quarter of the annual production is estimated to be lost at the three harbors due to lockdown. Our last observation (September 2020) result shows that regular fishing activity has already been re-established in all three locations. PlanetScope data with daily revisit time has a higher potential to be used in the future and can help policymakers in making informed decisions vis-à-vis the fishing industry during an emergency situation like COVID-19. © 2021 by the authors.",2021,"Remote Sensing","13","2","1-20",NA,"10.3390/rs13020183","Asia"

Disrupted FSC escalated the societal concerns related to food safety and security. The purpose of this study is to consolidate various issues, exploring the perspectives associated with the agricultural practices, food industries and society concerns related with the FSC performance system dynamics amid of COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: To structure this work, a detailed research literature insight focussing on the key findings associated with the past disease outbreaks like influenza, avian flu, Ebola, bird flu, SARS, foot and mouth disease and ongoing phase of COVID-19, encompassing the perspective related with various agricultural and concerned supply chain practices is clustered. Furthermore, issues having relevancy with the notion of this work, sourced from platforms of print and electronic media have been incorporated to ground the reality associated with the impacts, for better visualisation of the perspectives. Findings: This study outlays the key findings which are relevant with the past pandemic outbreaks from the core of the research literature. It details the impact of the current COVID-19 scenario on the various FSC operations, focussing on dimensions allied with the industry, economic and society concerns. For the same, to mitigate the effects, relief measures focussing on the short- and long-term perspectives have been incorporated. Steps ramped up by the Government of India (GOI) to safeguard masses from the threat of food security, accelerate pace of the FSC operations and upscale operating capacities of the industries and agriculture practices have incorporated. Research limitations/implications: Presented work is persuaded amid of the COVID-19 lockdown restrictions hence it outlays the theoretical perspectives only. But, these perspectives portray the ongoing scenario's impacts, extending its implication to the people coming from the industry and academia background. This study can felicitate the government bodies to make them familiar with the various impacts which indented the FSCs, food industries and added woes to the society concerns. Originality/value: India is the second largest populated nation of the world, and outspread of the COVID-19 has capsized the FSCs and raised the various instances, making population vulnerable to the threats of food insecurity.

"119","COVID-19 pandemic: lockdown impacts on the Indian environment, agriculture and aquaculture","Mohanty, R. K.; Mandal, K. G.; Thakur, A. K.","The COVID-19 pandemic is an extreme event. Lockdown in India, in a bid to slow down the pandemic, helped in reducing air pollution levels of major industrial cities (60–70%), due to significant improvement in the air quality index. This has also contributed in reducing global carbon emissions and greenhouse gas emissions. There has been a 40–50% improvement in the riverine water quality in terms of dissolved oxygen, biological oxygen demand, coliform bacteria levels and suspended particulate matter. These short-term environmental benefits may even pose larger threat to the environment during the post-lockdown ‘as usual scenario’. Due to lockdown, agriculture and aquaculture sectors have also been severely affected. Delayed harvesting in aquaculture negatively impacted the production cost, water productivity and footprint, total water use and water use efficiency. The COVID-19 crisis has shown the vulnerability of regional to global systems in protecting our health, environment and economy. Further, this pandemic has forced us to re-examine our relationship with nature for better association.

"121","Disruptive Technologies for Achieving Supply Chain Resilience in COVID-19 Era: An Implementation Case Study of Satellite Imagery and Blockchain Technologies in Fish Supply Chain","Sengupta, T.; Narayanamurthy, G.; Moser, R.; Pereira, V.; Bhattacharjee, D.","In supply chains where stakeholders belong to the economically disadvantaged segment and form an important part of the supply chain distribution, the complexities grow manifold. Fisheries in developing nations are one such sector where the complexity is not only due to the produce being perishable but also due to the livelihood dependence of others in the coastal regions that belong to the section of economically disadvantaged. This paper explains the contextual challenges of fish supply chain in a developing country and describes how integrating disruptive technologies can address those challenges. Through a positive deviance approach, we show how firms can help unorganized supply chains with economically disadvantaged suppliers by carefully redesigning the supply chain through the integration of satellite imagery and blockchain technology. With COVID-19 in the backdrop, we highlight how such technologies significantly improves the supply chain resilience and at the same time contributes to the income generating opportunities of poor fisherfolks in developing nations. Our study has important implications to both developing markets and food supply chain practitioners as this paper tackles issues such as perishability, demand-supply mismatch, unfair prices, and quality related data transparency in the entire value chain.",2021,"Inf Syst Front","","","1-17",34876876,"10.1007/s10796-021-10228-3","Asia"

K.; Anand, P. R.; Ravisankar, T.; Angel, J. R. J.; De, D.; Muralidhar, M.; Patil, P. K.; Vijayan, K. K.","The lockdown on account of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) adversely impacted the food production sector including aquaculture, globally. Unfortunately, it coincided with the major shrimp farming season in India which contributes 60% of the national annual shrimp production hence the impact was substantial. An on-line survey was carried out among the stakeholders of the shrimp farming sector to evaluate the prospective impact of COVID-19 related lockdown across the shrimp supply chain. The study estimated an economic loss of 1.50 billion USD to the shrimp aquaculture sector during the current year. It is expected that shrimp production and its export performance may be declining by 40% in the current season. The Garret ranking and Rank Based Quotient analyses projected severe constraints in shrimp seed production and supply, disruptions in the supply chain, logistics, farming, processing, marketing and loss of employment and income for the workers due to the pandemic. To mitigate the impact, the Government of India declared fisheries and aquaculture as an essential activity, facilitated the movement of inputs and services. Further, a major Fisheries Development Scheme(PMMSY) with a financial outlay of 267 million USD has been announced to usher in a blue revolution by strengthening the value chain, doubling the fisher/farmer income, employment generation, economic and social security for fishers/fish farmers adhering to the sustainability principles.

"123","COVID-19 and surface water quality: Improved lake water quality during the lockdown","Yunus, A. P.; Masago, Y.; Hijioka, Y.","Human life comes to a standstill as many countries shut themselves off from the work due to the novel coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19) that hit the world severely in the first quarter of 2020. All types of industries, vehicle movement, and people's activity suddenly halted, perhaps for the first time in modern history. For a long time, it has been stated in various literature that the increased industrialization and anthropogenic activities in the last two decades polluted the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. Since the industries and people's activities have been shut off for a month or more in many parts of the world, it is expected to show some improvement in the prevailing conditions in the aforementioned spheres of environment. Here, with the help of remote sensing images, this work quantitatively demonstrated the improvement in surface water quality in terms of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the Vembanad Lake, the longest freshwater lake in India. The SPM estimated based on established turbidity algorithm from Landsat-8 OLI images showed that the SPM concentration during the lockdown period decreased by 15.9% on average (range: -10.3% to 36.4%, up to 8 mg/l decrease) compared with the pre-lockdown period. Time series analysis of satellite image collections (April 2013 - April 2020) showed that the SPM quantified for April 2020 is the lowest for 11 out of 20 zones of the Vembanad lake. When compared with preceding years, the percentage decrease in SPM for April 2020 is up to 34% from the previous minima.",2020,"Sci Total Environ","731","","139012",32388159,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139012","Asia"

V.","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the entire world and has had a devastating impact on both lives and livelihoods in India. The only way to defeat the rapid spread of COVID-19, is to shut down socio-economic activities and to maintain minimal human interaction with the implementation of a lockdown. Such lockdowns have manifested in a pollution curtailment in almost all spheres of the planet, including in marine pollution. Quantifying this decrease in pollution levels enables the scientific community to assess the contribution of anthropogenic (especially non-essential) activities to global/regional pollution levels. This paper aims to study the impact of the stringent lockdown period (phase 1 and 2) on coastal water quality along the Chennai coast of India, by analyzing suspended matter concentration (SPM), a key element of water quality and diffuse attenuation coefficient, Kd(490), using LANDSAT-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data. LANDSAT-8/OLI, L1TP scenes were subjected to radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction to derive surface reflectance values from raw digital numbers using ACOLITE software and a brief insight has been given for the Dark Spectrum Fitting algorithm used in ACOLITE. SPM concentration decreased by 15.48 and 37.50% in the Chennai and Ennore ports, respectively, due to minimal vessel movement and cargo handling. The stringent lockdown led to the operation of fewer thermal plant units, thus less fly ash was emanated, resulting in a 28.05% reduction in SPM levels over Ennore creek. As industrial and commercial activities subsided, the city’s water bodies became clearer than they were just a fortnight prior to the lockdown, with a reduction of 22.26% of SPM in Adyar and 33.97% in Cooum riverine estuaries. Decrease in Kd(490) showed a positive relationship with SPM and thus improved coastal water quality because of the reduction of SPM during this period. The variations in PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations were studied using National Air Quality Monitoring Programme (NAMP) data and reduced levels in particulate matter concentration (PM2.5 and PM10) for the Adyar residential area (24.38 and 28.43%) and for the Nungampakkam commercial area (36.09 and 67.18%) were observed. A significant reduction in PM2.5 concentration (45.63%) was observed in the Ennore-Manali Industrial region. © Copyright © 2021 Vijay Prakash, Geetha Vimala, Preethi Latha, Jayaram, Nagamani and Laxmi.",2021,"Frontiers in Marine Science","8","","",NA,"10.3389/fmars.2021.659686","Asia"

V.; Roy, A.","Crop diversity is thought to have small, positive impacts on dietary diversity among farming households, particularly when market access is restricted. Policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic severely restricted market access. To date, no study has explored the relationship between crop and dietary diversity in this context. To address this gap, we used longitudinal data collected from 833 farmers across 12 states in India at three time points between May and August 2020. Dietary diversity was measured using a modified version of the FAO Minimum Dietary Diversity score for women, which has been used in representative samples of the Indian population in both men and women. Eight food groups were included: (1) starchy staples (rice, wheat, and potatoes), (2) pulses, (3) nuts, (4) vegetables, (5) fruits, (6) dairy, (7) eggs, and (8) fleshy foods (meat, poultry, and fish). Multivariate polynomial logistic regression was used to estimate the association between crop and dietary diversity. Models were adjusted for educational attainment, caste, farm size, having a kitchen garden, and livestock ownership. Participants were, on average, 42.2 years old and 94.2% were male. Dietary diversity decreased over the study period, especially between baseline and follow-up 1, when lockdown measures were the most restrictive (34.2% of participants experienced a decline compared to 16.1% from follow-up 1 to follow-up 2). Compared to farmers who cultivated 1 crop (monocroppers), farmers who cultivated 2 crops or 3 or more crops were significantly less likely to experience a decline in dietary diversity from baseline to follow-up 1: adjusted relative risk (RR) (95% confidence interval [CI]), 0.52 (0.35, 0.78) and 0.48 (0.31, 0.75), respectively. There was no significant association between crop diversity and change in dietary diversity from follow-up 1 to follow-up 2, when phased re-opening had begun. These findings suggest that farmers with greater crop diversity in India were more resilient to market disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, while the links between crop and dietary diversity may be small under normal circumstances, diversifying production systems may play an increasingly important role, as there is greater uncertainty due to global events such as pandemics and climate change. © Copyright © 2021 Connors, Jaacks, Prabhakaran, Veluguri, Ramanjaneyulu and Roy.",2021,"Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems","5","","",NA,"10.3389/fsufs.2021.695347","Asia"

M.; Veluguri, D.; Serupally, R.; Roy, A.; Prabhakaran, P.; Ramanjaneyulu, G.","The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on agricultural production, livelihoods, food security, and dietary diversity in India. Phone interview surveys were conducted by trained enumerators across 12 states and 200 districts in India from 3 to 15 May 2020. A total of 1437 farmers completed the survey (94% male; 28% 30–39 years old; 38% with secondary schooling). About one in ten farmers (11%) did not harvest in the past month with primary reasons cited being unfavorable weather (37%) and lockdown-related reasons (24%). A total of 63% of farmers harvested in the past month (primarily wheat and vegetables), but only 44% had sold their crop; 12% were still trying to sell their crop, and 39% had stored their crop, with more than half (55%) reporting lockdown-related issues as the reason for storing. Seventy-nine percent of households with wage-workers witnessed a decline in wages in the past month and 49% of households with incomes from livestock witnessed a decline. Landless farmers were about 10 times more likely to skip a meal as compared to large farmers (18% versus 2%), but a majority reported receiving extra food rations from the government. Nearly all farmers reported consuming staple grains daily in the past week (97%), 63% consumed dairy daily, 40% vegetables daily, 26% pulses daily, and 7% fruit daily. These values are much lower than reported previously for farmers in India around this time of year before COVID-19: 94–95% dairy daily, 57–58% pulses daily, 64–65% vegetables daily, and 42–43% fruit daily. In conclusion, we found that the COVID-19 lockdown in India has primarily impacted farmers’ ability to sell their crops and livestock products and decreased daily wages and dietary diversity. © 2021, The Author(s).",2021,"Food Security","13","5","1323-1339",NA,"10.1007/s12571-021-01164-w","Asia"

Y.; Roy, P. D.; Muthukumar, P.; Kumar, M.","Globally, the incidences of environmental improvements owing to seizing the anthropogenic activities during the lockdown have been reported through news articles and photographs, yet a formal scholarly study has been lacking to substantiate the imprints of lockdown. We hereby present the imprints of lockdown on water quality (both chemical and biological) parameters during the nationwide lockdown (COVID-19 epidemic) in India between 25th March to 30th May 2020. The present study describes the changes in chemical and biological water quality parameters based on twenty-two groundwater samples from the coastal industrial city of Tuticorin in Southern India, taken before (10 and 11th February 2020) and during the lockdown (19 and 20th April 2020) periods. The physico-chemical parameters compared are pH, total dissolved solids (TDS) and electrical conductivity (EC), nitrate (NO(3)), fluoride (F), chromium (Cr), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), and selenium (Se), and the bacterial parameters are total coliforms, fecal coliforms, E. coli, and fecal streptococci. Among the metals, the significant reductions in Se (42%), As (51%), Fe (60%) and Pb (50%) were noticed probably owing to no or very less wastewater discharges from metal-based industries, seafood-based industries and thermal power plants during the lockdown. Reduction in NO(3) (56%), total coliform (52%) and fecal coliforms (48%) indicated less organic sewage from the fishing industries. Contents of Cr, Cu, Zn and Cd, however, remained similar and fluoride did not show any change, probably as they were sourced from rock-water interactions. Similarly, we did not observe alterations in E. coli and fecal streptococci due to no significant change in domestic sewage production during the lockdown. The multivariate analyses aptly illustrated this and the principal component analyses helped to identify the sources that controlled water qualities of the lockdown compared to the pre-lockdown period. Our observation implies that groundwater is definitely under active interaction with surface waters and thus a quick revival could be observed following the seizing of anthropogenic activities.",2020,"Sci Total Environ","738","","139848",32574914,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139848","Asia"

K.; Mainuddin, M.; Banerjee, H.; Timsina, J.; Majumdar, K.","The shock of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has disrupted food systems worldwide. Such disruption, affecting multiple systems interfaces in smallholder agriculture, is unprecedented and needs to be understood from multi-stakeholder perspectives. The multiple loops of causality in the pathways of impact renders the system outcomes unpredictable. Understanding the nature of such unpredictable pathways is critical to identify present and future systems intervention strategies. Our study aims to explore the multiple pathways of present and future impact created by the pandemic and ""Amphan"" cyclonic storm on smallholder agricultural systems. Also, we anticipate the behaviour of the systems elements under different realistic scenarios of intervention. We explored the severity and multi-faceted impacts of the pandemic on vulnerable smallholder agricultural production systems through in-depth interactions with key players at the micro-level. It provided contextual information, and revealed critical insights to understand the cascading effect of the pandemic and the cyclone on farm households. We employed thematic analysis of in-depth interviews with multiple stakeholders in Sundarbans areas in eastern India, to identify the present and future systems outcomes caused by the pandemic, and later compounded by ""Amphan"". The immediate adaptation strategies of the farmers were engaging family labors, exchanging labors with neighbouring farmers, borrowing money from relatives, accessing free food rations, replacing dead livestock, early harvesting, and reclamation of waterbodies. The thematic analysis identified several systems elements, such as harvesting, marketing, labor accessibility, among others, through which the impacts of the pandemic were expressed. Drawing on these outputs, we employed Mental Modeler, a Fuzzy-Logic Cognitive Mapping tool, to develop multi-stakeholder mental models for the smallholder agricultural systems of the region. Analysis of the mental models indicated the centrality of ""Kharif"" (monsoon) rice production, current farm income, and investment for the next crop cycle to determine the pathways and degree of the dual impact on farm households. Current household expenditure, livestock, and soil fertility were other central elements in the shared mental model. Scenario analysis with multiple stakeholders suggested enhanced market access and current household income, sustained investment in farming, rapid improvement in affected soil, irrigation water and livestock as the most effective strategies to enhance the resilience of farm families during and after the pandemic. This study may help in formulating short and long-term intervention strategies in the post-pandemic communities, and the methodological approach can be used elsewhere to understand perturbed socioecological systems to formulate anticipatory intervention strategies based on collective wisdom of stakeholders.",2021,"Agric Syst","189","","103051",33814677,"10.1016/j.agsy.2021.103051","Asia"

K.; Adhav, C. A.; Sendhil, R.; Ramasundaram, P.","Distortion in distribution and consumption of agricultural commodities is a result of disruptive shocks in prices and food value chains leading to a significant food loss as well as waste. We investigated the COVID-19 induced lockdown effects in India through an interrupted time series analysis coupled with a survey result of 729 consumers, 225 farmers and synthesis of the literature evidence on food loss as well as food waste. Our article complements the literature inventory on COVID-19 by estimating and tracking the effects on prices and consumer behaviour apart from discussing the implications for food loss and waste. Prices post-lockdown shot up immediately and significantly for chickpea (4.8%), mung bean (5.2%), and tomato (78.2%) corroborating the loss in highly perishable product – tomato – owing to its spiked price. We find no structural break in prices due to lockdown implying that lockdown-induced price change was not sufficient to alter the long-run price movement, and the prices of the major commodities reverted to the pre-lockdown levels. The pandemic induced lockdown did restrict the access to food markets and a majority of consumers (75.31%) experienced a price increase across COVID zones of different intensity of incidence leading to food loss along supply chain and wastage at consumers end. Consumers’ livelihood affected from moderate (59.53%) to severe (3.3%) with 92 per cent reporting a change in shopping behavior. The Kruskal-Wallis test on consumption behavior change indicated a significant shift among the consumers reporting altered income, mostly in the downside, post-lockdown. Despite the relaxation for agricultural related activities during the lockdown, farmers reported disruption in disposing their winter produce barring wheat, bolstered by a record state procurement in 2020. The paper affirms that the pandemic has caused a significant price change and unprecedented panic purchase that led to the food wastage but subsided soon exhibiting the resilience in Indian agriculture. We strongly recommend for promoting the capacity and collective resilience of small-scale production systems through institutions, policies and reforms. Contract farming, farmer producer organizations, creation and functioning of social safety nets to overcome income, production and price shocks, access to digital national markets and capacity building on food waste management practices will insulate vulnerable section as well as reduce the loss of food across supply chain. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,"Socio-Economic Planning Sciences","","","",NA,"10.1016/j.seps.2021.101160","Asia"

We conducted an online cross-sectional survey to assess COVID-19 pandemic-induced dietary and lifestyle changes and their association with perceived health status and self-reported body weight changes among 1000 Indian adults in early 2021. Positive improvements in dietary habits, e.g., eating more nutritious (85% of participants) and home-cooked food (89%) and an increase in overall nutrition intake (79%), were observed. Sixty-five percent of participants self-reported increased oat consumption to support immunity. There were some negative changes, e.g., more binge eating (69%), eating more in between meals (67%), and increasing meal portion size (72%). Two-thirds of participants reported no change in lifestyles, whereas 21 and 23% reported an increase, and 13 and 10% reported a decrease in physical activity and sleep, respectively. Overall, 64 and 65% of participants reported an improvement in perceived health and an increase in body weight during the COVID-19 period compared to pre-COVID-19, respectively. The top motivations for improving dietary habits included improving physical and mental health and building immunity. In conclusion, the overall perceived health was improved and there was an increase in self-reported body weight in most participants during COVID-19. Diet emerged as the most crucial determinant for these changes.",2021,"Nutrients","13","11","",34835938,"10.3390/nu13113682","Asia"

V.; Das, M.","India successfully executed one of the strictest lockdowns in the world during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, which provided unique opportunities to analyze the second-largest populous country's anthropogenic footprint on its natural systems. India's first Ramsar site and the world's second-largest brackish water system Chilika lagoon experienced a substantial decline (64%) in the total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPHC) level in water, which was attributed to the massive declines or, at times, an abrupt complete halt of motorized boat operations for fishing and tourism. Using the TPHC values during the lockdown period, our study recommends a TPHC baseline threshold of 2.02 μg L(-1) and 0.91 μg g(-1) for Chilika waters and sediment, respectively. These baseline values can be used to quantify oil pollution and to formulate policy and management action plans for Chilika lagoon as well as for other similar ecosystems by local environmental agencies.",2022,"Mar Pollut Bull","174","","113137",34863069,"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.113137","Asia"
"139","Ethical reflections on the COVID-19 pandemic in the global seafood industry: navigating diverse scales and contexts of marine values and identities","Lam, M. E.","The global crisis instantiated by the COVID-19 pandemic opens a unique governance window to transform the sustainability, resilience, and ethics of the global seafood industry. Simultaneously crippling public health, civil liberties, and national economies, the global pandemic has exposed the diverse values and identities of actors upon which global food systems pivot, as well as their interconnectivity with other economic sectors and spheres of human activity. In the wake of COVID-19, ethics offers a timely conceptual reframing and methodological approach to navigate these diverse values and identities and to reconcile their ensuing policy trade-offs and conflicts. Values and identities denote complex concepts and realities, characterized by plurality, fluidity and dynamics, ambiguity, and implicitness, which often hamper responsive policy-setting and effective governance. Rather than adopt a static characterization of specific value or identity types, I introduce a novel hierarchical conceptualization of values and identities made salient by scale and context. I illustrate how salient values and identities emerge at multiple scales through three seafood COVID-19 contextual examples in India, Canada, and New Zealand, where diverse seafood actors interact within local, domestic (regional/national), and global seafood value chains, respectively. These examples highlight the differential values and identities, and hence differential vulnerabilities, resilience, and impacts on seafood actors with the COVID-19 pandemic, which necessitate differentiated policy interventions if they are to be responsive to those affected. An ethical governance framework that integrates diverse marine values and identities, buttressed by concrete deliberation and decision-support protocols and tools, can transform the modus operandi of global seafood systems toward both sustainable and ethical development. © 2021, The Author(s).",2021,"Maritime Studies","20","4","501-516",NA,"10.1007/s40152-021-00247-w","Asia"
"140","Monitoring the COVID-19-affected Indonesian seaweed industry using remote sensing data","Langford, A.; Waldron, S.; Sulfahri,; Saleh, H.","The Indonesian seaweed industry has rapidly expanded over the last twenty years and now contributes to the livelihoods of 267,000 coastal households. Policy makers need accurate information from which to base policy that improves the livelihoods of smallholder farmers without further straining natural resource limits. The sustained growth of the sector necessitates means for reporting and monitoring the sector, particularly in the context of COVID-19. This paper uses newly available, high resolution, high frequency satellite data from April 2017 to December 2020 to identify seaweed farming plots and to map the seasonal changes in the industry. This is overlaid with data on environmental factors, prices, and official production statistics to reveal a range of insights into the industry which are obscured by official annual data, such as the seasonality of production and the change in activity since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The paper evaluates the usefulness of this data for monitoring the industry and informing strategic policy decisions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,"Marine Policy","127","","",NA,"10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104431","Asia"

F.; Rosa, E. D. L.; Suherfian, W.; Yuliani, A.; Kushardanto, H.; Muawanah, U.; Rukma, A.; Alimi, T.; Box, S.","The volume and value of fish catches by Indonesia's small-scale fisheries have declined significantly since national government restrictions on travel and social distancing were imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a digital data collection system (OurFish), that records purchases by fish traders from small-scale fishers, data was collected across 82 coastal communities in Southeast Sulawesi. We found that the number of active fishers and traders declined by more than 90% after the onset of the pandemic and the average weight of catch per fishing trip increased across fishers. Although the average price per kilogram of fish declined after the pandemic began, fishers that were able to maintain fishing had on average higher catches and therefore daily catch value was maintained. High value fisheries that usually enter export supply chains were more negatively impacted compared with lower value species that are commonly sold to local markets. We interviewed 185 small scale fishers and fish traders across 20 of the 82 communities in Southeast Sulawesi province, recording the perceived level of impact on local fisheries and the fish trade, causes of this impact and proposed coping strategies. Over 50% of both fishers and fish traders believed low demand for fish from traders and a decline in the price received for fish were disrupting their lives. Approximately 75% of both male and female fishers are coping by continuing to fish, highlighting that there were few alternative livelihoods available at the time of the interviews. Our results provide key insights into the vulnerability of small-scale fishing communities to impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2021,"Ocean and Coastal Management","200","","",NA,"10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.105485","Asia"

A.; Taridala, S. A. A.","Unprepared mitigation due to the Covid-19 pandemic caused disruption in the food supply chain. On the other hand, food needs increased along with the implementation of lockdown. It includes one of the blue swimmer crab (Portunus pelagicus) raw material suppliers, the Spelman Strait's coastal waters which experienced supply chain disruptions during the Covid-19 pandemic, compared to before the pandemic. This raises concerns that in the future, the Covid-19 pandemic will cause new unemployment. The purpose of this study was to determine the extent of the blue swimmer crab supply chain before and during the Covid-19 pandemic and the role of the Central Buton Regency Government in addressing these problems. The data analysis applied is a socio-ecological system approach based on the spider diagram model. Respondents were selected using the purposive sampling method. Furthermore, the research results showed that the blue swimmer crab supply chain in the Spelman Strait experienced disruption. Since the catch of fishers are not accommodated by the local collectors, exporters did not provide local collectors either. Before and during the Covid-19 pandemic, there was no intervention from the local government in the supply chain. The supply chain that currently works formed its networking independently. Therefore, both central and local governments must have concern and support for supply chain risks for coastal fisheries actors. It can be applied through the formulation and implementation of information systems and network policies. © 2021, BIOFLUX SRL.

A.","Most of professions in the informal sector in Kenjeran area are fishermen, fish processors, marine craftsmen and makers of processed fish-based products. Fishermen are susceptible to Covid-19 transmission. This study aimed to identify the risk of being exposed to Covid-19 for fishermen in Kenjeran area. Method: The sample in this study were 70 fishermen taken through the total sampling method. The variables in this study were hazard, hazard identification, risk assessment and risk control. The data were collected using a questionnaire and observation. The results of risk identification were assigned a value (risk value) to determine the control. The risk assessment used the AS / NZS 4360: 2004 standard. Result: Based on the risk analysis table, it can be seen that fishermen's activities that carry medium and high risks include equipment preparation, weighing of fish haul, sales of fish and meeting with fellow fishermen. Conclusion: The risk of contracting Covid-19 for fishermen was higher outside their workplace. The fishermen do a lot of activities outside of their work. © 2020 EManuscript Technologies.

"144","An assessment of the short-term impact of COVID-19 on economics and the environment: A case study of Indonesia","Malahayati, M.; Masui, T.; Anggraeni, L.","The COVID-19 pandemic has already made a significant impact on various sectors. No country was fully prepared to face this global pandemic, and Indonesia is no exception. For Indonesia, this pandemic shook not only the public health service system but also the economy. This study makes projections related to the impact of this pandemic on the Indonesian economy by utilising a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. Additionally, we calculate the land needed to cover the demand for agricultural products, as well as the level to which emissions can be reduced. Our simulation shows that, along with every shock caused by COVID-19 to national supply and demand, Indonesia will be experiencing economic stagnation by 2021, with the gross domestic product (GDP) level 4–8% lower than the business as usual (BAU) level during the pandemic (2020–2021). The two sectors that will be hit hardest are the transportation and tourism sectors, making up a GDP loss ranging from 30% to 50%. During this stagnation, the agricultural sector is a potential sector for accommodating workers who have been laid off. The model also predicts that there will be a temporary land-use change that the farmers will prefer to use their land for food and horticultural commodities. As for emissions, our calculations show that the potential for emission reductions will be up to 8% by 2021, compared to the BAU level. However, the source of this emission reduction is not positive as it comes from the restriction of economic activity, and the growth in emissions from the industrial and waste sectors are still increasing rapidly, even during the pandemic. Thus, it is feared that there will be a very high spike in emissions when the pandemic ends, making the situation more challenging for Indonesia to achieve its emission mitigation targets. Furthermore, once the government introduces fiscal incentives to support the economy during the pandemic, the economic condition will be improved, although still not fully recovered. The model predicts that the government fiscal incentives may help to improve the GDP by around 1–3%, compared to when no incentive is introduced. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2022,"EconomiA","","","",NA,"10.1016/j.econ.2021.12.003","Asia"

The aim is to describe and analyze the capacity of poor women as family head in strengthening food security in the new normal period. The focus of this research is the family head of poor women in the city of Surakarta, Central Java, Indonesia. The results showed that the resilience of poor women's household heads was hindered by the legal identity they did not have after divorcing from their husbands. A legal identity will provide a foundation for women to access closed opportunities, because poor women do not understand legal identity is a prerequisite for accessing assistance in poverty alleviation programs. Fortunately, these poor women head of households have excellent resilience to maintain food security for their families. Their resilience is currently heavier than the monetary crisis in 1989-1999, because at this time they have to compete with others who are more knowledgeable in information technology. As the recommendations, the results of this study are aimed at the city government of Surakarta to develop a different affirmative strategy to strengthen family food security, especially for poor female household heads. © 2021, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

Y.; Lee, C. H.","Marine debris, a global environmental issue today, is a major threat to Bali seas which are famous for its natural beauty and aggravated by the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to determine the characteristics of marine debris in Bali Island, especially in the southern region and to analyze the feasibility of incineration as one of the waste treatment processes. This research was conducted by utilizing secondary data and literature reviews from related previous studies. Water content and caloric value were measured directly using the ASTM E 790-15 and ASTM D 5865-11a standards. Marine debris generation from 2013 to 2019 tends to decrease from 1.22 kg/km.day to 0.46 kg/km.day. Organic waste (59.4%) comprised the largest marine debris followed by plastic waste (13.4%) and diapers (11.9%). Thermal technology such as incineration can be introduced to treat marine debris. The standard application of incinerator technology is moisture content and caloric value. The water content of marine debris is reportedly 54.56%, therefore, further preliminary processing is needed, especially for waste with high moisture content, such as diapers and organic waste. The potential calorific value of marine debris during the COVID-19 pandemic obtained from calculating the total waste was 12.05 MJ/kg which still did not meet the incinerator application’s standard criteria. © 2021 Faculty of Fisheries and Marine Universitas Airlangga.",2021,"Jurnal Ilmiah Perikanan dan Kelautan","13","2","70-78",NA,"10.20473/jipk.v13i2.25164","Asia"

R.; Wibowo, S.; Yuniarto, Y.","Purpose: This study aims to measure whether market orientation, entrepreneurial orientation, and marketing capabilities affected the business performance of salted fish distribution in Kapuk warehouse, West Jakarta at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. This prolonged and difficult pandemic has had an impact on the business of selling salted fish, challenging organisations’ ability to maintain business performance. Research design, data and methodology: This study uses a PLS-SEM model approach using Smart PLS 3.0 and a questionnaire as the instruments. The conditions during the observation include 77 distributors who chose to keep doing business, and the research sample were measured by the number of distributors (business actors or people in charge). In this study, the variables of marketing capabilities, market orientation, and entrepreneurial orientation were used to analyse business performance. Results: Interestingly, the results of the study succeeded in explaining that during a pandemic market, both entrepreneurial orientation and marketing ability affected current business performance, although marketing ability remains an inconsistent mediator. Conclusions: This result serves as a reminder that surviving is the priority which must be focused on now, rather than crafting strategies to excel in competition that consume valuable effort and resources. © 2021.

"148","SMALLHOLDER FARMERS' CHALLENGES OF COPING WITH COVID-19 CONTAINMENTS: INSIGHTS FROM TWO FOOD REGIONS IN INDONESIA","Stöber, S.; Adinata, K.; Ramba, T.; Paganini, N.; Sulejmanović, N.","The COVID-19 pandemic has forced governments around the world to impose containment measures to prevent the rapid spread of the corona virus. The Indonesian government implemented “large-scale social restrictions,” which have impacted farming and farmers' food security. Farmers are both producers and consumers of food and, therefore, have been facing new challenges due to transport restrictions, price spikes for inputs, price drops for their produce, or conditions which aggravated cooperation, such as social distancing. This study aims at analysing the challenges of the containments from a smallholder farmer perspective and examining farmers' coping potential. A digital survey with 323 farmers has been designed as comparative observational research in Toraja, South Sulawesi, and selected regions of Java. The Bonferroni Multiple Comparison Test was used to test for significance regarding socioeconomic factors and space. A logistic regression model extracted determinants for crisis coping. Results reveal, that female farmers worry more about COVID-19 outbreak compared to men at a significant level. In contrast, male farmers, particularly in Java, are more concerned about social restrictions due to limited mobility. Food price spikes were reported in both regions, with sharp increases for fish, fruits, and vegetables in Java, for staples in Toraja, and for meat and sugar in both regions. Food groups, that trade through agents and brokers or are transported longer distances were affected most due to their complex and long supply chains that were disrupted during the restrictions. In Java, farmers face multiple shocks, of which climate change was reported even more often than the pandemic related shocks. Not being able to help each other on the farm due to social distancing is a significant concern of farmers in Toraja. As a result of food market disturbances, farmers began to grow and eat more vegetables and fruits. In conclusion, food security for farmers slightly decreased due to affordability, and market disruptions already point to long-term income losses. The study team recommends to promote smallholders' healthy food production, value addition and direct end-consumer linkages to build back better their livelihoods post-COVID-19. © 2021.

O.; Rayuddin,; Hartati,","This study aims to analyze the abalone marketing in Buton Island and its performance during the Covid-19 pandemic. Abalone is one of Indonesian marine resources with great potential to be developed. The high demand for abalone is usually not met with enough supplies, resulting in its expensive price. Sources are scattered and in remote locations, creating the need for marketing institutions. The study took place in Bajo Bahari village (Buton regency) and Baubau (a city in Southeast Sulawesi), Indonesia. The data was initially collected in February to May 2015, and later in March 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic hit. The study consists of all 30 Bajo Bahari abalone fishermen. Additionally, 5 abalone merchants were chosen using snowball sampling method; which consists of 3 village abalone collector (VAC) and 2 wholesalers who act as the inter-island abalone trader (IAT). The abalone marketing performance was analyzed through the marketing margin and the fishermen's share, by first identifying the marketing channels. Results show two marketing channels were created, channel I (fishermen as producers→VAC→IAT) and channel II (fishermen as producers→IAT). Channel II showed better performance compared to channel I. Channel II had lower marketing margin (IDR 58,333) and high fishermen’s share, 72%. In contrast, channel I showed higher marketing margin (IDR 127,778) and low fishermen’s share, 16%. The Covid-19 pandemic poses challenges to the local abalone marketing, where fishing activities are stopped and disrupted the overall abalone marketing in Buton Island. © 2020, BIOFLUX SRL.

G.; Viswanathan, K. K.","This paper describes the impacts of and responses to COVID-19 of small-scale fisheries in six selected countries in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. The paper used a structured case study approach to analyse the impacts and responses and relied heavily on existing reports and data sources in each country. The pandemic has further revealed the vulnerability of small-scale fishing households in the region. Given the few assets of fisher households, their ability to cushion the negative impact of crises and shocks is limited. Fishers made adaptive responses such as direct fish marketing, online marketing, and home delivery services. While short-term responses of providing food and financial assistance have been helpful, long-term support to address pandemics such as COVID-19 and other stressors will require developing more resilient fishing households. The paper recommends several approaches and interventions to improve household resilience and to be better prepared for similar challenges and threats in the future. These include: i) strengthening the fishing households’ social network of friends, relatives, and neighbours to serve as both a social safety net and a bridge towards the transition to financial inclusion; ii) diversifying livelihood to reduce dependency on the fishery and provide for additional sources of income and food; iii) promoting financial inclusion through savings, credit, digital payment products, and insurance; iv) value chain upgrading through post-harvest fish handling and processing methods; and, v) providing access, especially for women, to social protection measures such as government health insurance and social security. © Asian Fisheries Society.",2021,"Asian Fisheries Science","34","1","99-113",NA,"10.33997/j.afs.2021.34.1.011","Asia"

K.; Advani, S.; Giordano, C.","The COVID-19 pandemic and response has significantly disrupted fishery supply chains, creating shortages of essential foods and constraining livelihoods globally. Small-scale fisheries (SSFs) are responding to the pandemic in a variety of ways. Together, disruptions from and responses to COVID-19 illuminate existing vulnerabilities in the fish distribution paradigm and possible means of reducing system and actor sensitivity and exposure and increasing adaptive capacity. Integrating concepts from literature on supply chain disruptions, social-ecological systems, human wellbeing, vulnerability, and SSFs, we synthesize preliminary lessons from six case studies from Indonesia, the Philippines, Peru, Canada, and the United States. The SSF supply chains examined employ different distribution strategies and operate in different geographic, political, social, economic, and cultural contexts. Specifically, we ask (a) how resilient have different SSF supply chains been to COVID-19 impacts; (b) what do these initial outcomes indicate about the role of distribution strategies in determining the vulnerability of SSF supply chains to macroeconomic shocks; and (c) what key factors have shaped this vulnerability? Based on our findings, systemic changes that may reduce SSF vulnerability to future macroeconomic shocks include: diversification of distribution strategies, livelihoods, and products; development of local and domestic markets and distribution channels; reduced reliance on international markets; establishment of effective communication channels; and preparation for providing aid to directly assist supply chains and support consumer purchasing power. © 2021, The Author(s).",2022,"Maritime Studies","","","",NA,"10.1007/s40152-021-00231-4","Asia"

Generalized linear mixed models were used to estimate the frequencies of food intake associated with the pandemic and work and life patterns. During the state of emergency, the frequency of intake of vegetables, beans, seaweeds, fish, meats, dairy products, and snacks increased, whereas alcohol intake decreased. Working from home was associated with increased intake of vegetables, fruits, dairy products, and snacks but decreased intake of seaweeds, meats, and alcohol. Time spent on childcare was associated with decreased intake of vegetables and fruits but increased intake of meats.

"157","Evaluating the impact of COVID-19 on ex-vessel prices using time-series analysis","Abe, K.; Ishimura, G.; Baba, S.; Yasui, S.; Nakamura, K.","The spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and subsequent lockdown measures have impacted economies and industries worldwide. The fisheries industry witnessed a sharp decline in demand and a slump in fish prices due to its dependence on the food service industry. It is important to quantitatively assess those fish species affected most and the extent of the pandemic's impact on them, to take specific countermeasures. We propose a time-series analysis as an alternative to the current practice of using ad hoc year-on-year comparisons. Although the pandemic makes it difficult to construct a counterfactual approach due to the lack of an appropriate control group, we use time-series forecasting to simulate normal conditions using pre-pandemic data. In Tokyo, the unit price of fish species that were negatively impacted by the food services industry dropped by 12.65% to 14.64%, and by 26.08% to 28.22% after the declaration of a state of emergency. Seasonality, short weekly cycles, and short-term market trends are factors that affect the price of fish. Species-specific impact estimates related to the COVID-19 pandemic can allow policymakers to implement recovery measures in a more targeted and effective manner. The results of our analysis can increase fishers' and policymakers' awareness of the usefulness of economic analyses and incentivize them to release data to establish a system to accumulate and analyze data strategically for urgent and appropriate interventions in the fisheries industry.",2022,"Fish Sci","","","1-12",35095191,"10.1007/s12562-021-01574-x","Asia"
"158","Changes in Selected Food Groups Consumption and Quality of Meals in Japanese School Children during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Horikawa, C.; Murayama, N.; Kojima, Y.; Tanaka, H.; Morisaki, N.","In 2020, a state of emergency was declared to control the devastating impact of coronavirus, leading to temporary school closures in Japan, meaning that school lunches were not provided to the majority of schoolchildren. Using questionnaires completed by participants' guardians, we examined the relationship between household income and the quality of meals in Japanese schoolchildren before, during, and after the state of emergency. Participants (1111 children, 10-14 years old) were chosen to form a nationally representative sample of the Japanese population. ""Well-balanced dietary intake"" was defined as the intake of (i) meat, fish, or eggs and (ii) vegetables. The desired prevalence was defined as equal to or more than twice a day. Household income was divided into quartiles. ""Well-balanced dietary intake"" was lower in all households during the state of emergency compared with before. The proportion of those with a ""well-balanced dietary intake"" at least twice a day was notably low in both Q3 and Q4 during the state of emergency compared with before the declared state of emergency; relative risk increase (95% CI) were Q1: -19.0% (-19.6% to -18.4%), p < 0.001, Q2: -21.3% (-22.1% to -20.6%) p < 0.001, Q3: -25.4% (-26.1% to -24.7%), p < 0.001, and Q4: -34.8% (-35.6% to -34.0%), p < 0.001. The interaction p (vs. Q1) of Q2, Q3, and Q4 were all <0.001. Guardians from low-income households had significantly higher rates of having less: time, psychological room, and financial position to prepare meals during the state of emergency.

These restrictions may have affected the food intake habits of frail older people more than non-frail older people. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between frailty and change in dietary habit during the pandemic. DESIGN: Cross-sectional mail survey. SETTING: Community-based. PARTICIPANTS: The study questionnaire was mailed to 4,436 older residents of Higashiura, Aich Japan, who were aged ≥75 years and who did not need care as of April 1, 2020. Of these, 2,738 participants provided complete answers to the questionnaires (75-96 years old, 49.3% males). MEASUREMENTS: The participants' frailty status and changes in food consumption during social isolation were assessed. Frailty status was assessed using the five-item frailty screening index (i.e., weight loss, low physical function, low physical activity, cognition, and exhaustion). Any participant who reported an increase or a decrease in ≥1 of the 12 food categories was defined as having change in dietary habit. Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of frailty for changes in diet were estimated by adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and living alone. In each of the 12 food categories, the proportion of participants with increased and decreased food intake was compared between the groups. RESULTS: Among the participants, 470 (17.2%) were frail, and 1,097 (40.1%) experienced a change in dietary habit under social restriction. The adjusted OR (95% CI) of the frail group for a change in dietary habit was 2.01 (1.63-2.47, p<0.001). Participants with decreased consumption of meat, fish, seaweed and mushroom, and fruits and those with increased consumption of eggs, bread, and noodles tended to be frail.

To examine this, a cross-sectional online survey was conducted in July 2020. Participants were 2285 adults aged 20-69 years who resided in any of 13 prefectures in Japan where specific COVID-19 regulations had been implemented. Self-reported changes in food-preparation practices when compared to the pre-COVID-19 pandemic period were measured as ""increased"" (24.6%), ""decreased"" (7.3%), and ""no change"" (68.1%), respectively. Stepwise logistic regression analyses indicated that participants who increased the time and effort for food preparation were younger in age, partially working remotely, experiencing reduced household income due to COVID-19, but highly concerned the importance of diet. On the other hand, participants whose household income decreased, and household economic status worsened, as well as those whose importance of diet deteriorated due to COVID-19 were more likely to decrease time and effort for cooking. Although the increased group were more likely to prepare meals with raw ingredients, the decreased group showed higher frequency of using takeout.

This study aimed to investigate diet quality by convenience food options (namely instant, frozen, and take-out foods) among Japanese school children during the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined the relationship between the frequency of consumption of convenience food options and nutritional status of the school children. The participants (671 children, 10–14 years old) were chosen to form a nationally representative sample of the Japanese population. Using questionnaires completed by the participants’ guardians, information was collected on the frequency of instant, frozen, and take-out food consumption. Habitual food and nutrient intake were collected using a validated food frequency questionnaire, completed by the children with help from their guardian(s). “Frequent” consumption was defined as consumption of instant, frozen, and/or take-out foods on more than 5 days per week. Using 19 nutrients and their respective dietary reference intake (DRI) values, an index was created to label each child’s nutrient intake as “Adequate”, “Inadequate”, “Excess”, or “Deficient.” Compared to children with non-frequent consumption, school children with frequent instant food consumption had significantly higher rates of inadequate nutrient intake (risk ratio (RR) = 3.0 [95% CI: 1.6–5.6]) and excess nutrient intake (RR = 2.3 [95% CI: 1.3–4.2]), while school children with frequent take-out food consumption had significantly higher rates of inadequate nutrient intake (RR = 2.1 [95% CI: 1.3–3.3]). There were no significant differences for children with frequent frozen-food intake. These associations did not change when adjusting for sociodemographic factors. Our results suggest that the frequent consumption of instant or take-out foods among school children results in non-adequate nutritional intake. © 2022 by the authors.

The aim of this study was to determine the cross-sectional association between frequency of balanced meal consumption and depressive symptoms among Japanese hospital workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Participants were 2,457 workers of the National Center for Global Health and Medicine who responded to a questionnaire survey in October or December 2020. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The number of days per week of eating two or more balanced meals was categorized into four from ≤1 day/week to daily. The association between frequency of balanced meal consumption and depressive symptoms was assessed using logistic regression analysis, with adjustment for lifestyle and COVID-19-related factors. RESULTS: The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 14.8%. The odds of depressive symptoms increased with decreasing frequency of balanced meal consumption.

An online cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted in November 2020 among 6000 Japanese adults (aged 20-64 years) registered with a research company and gathered data on demographics, socioeconomic factors, medical history, COVID-19 status of the respondent's family and neighbors, fear of COVID-19, and changes in lifestyle and dietary habits since the COVID-19 outbreak. To the question ""Have you made healthier changes to your dietary habits compared with the dietary habits before the spread of COVID-19 (1 year ago, November 2019)?"", 1215 (20.3%), 491 (8.2%), and 4294 (71.6%) participants answered that their dietary habits were healthier, unhealthier, and unchanged, respectively. Healthier and unhealthier dietary habits were associated with greater fear of COVID-19, altered exercise and sleep times, and smoking. Unhealthy habits were positively associated with living alone, decreasing household income, colleagues with COVID-19, stress, and weight loss/gain. Annual household income, changing household income, COVID-19 in friends, health literacy, exercise frequency, weight loss, and starting smoking were positively associated with healthier dietary changes.

With its long incubation period and highly contagious characteristics, most countries have initiated lockdown and social distancing is the new norm in most societies. Malaysia implemented the Movement Control Order (MCO) on 18 March 2020 when the cumulative COVID-19 cases were still below 800. Since then, MCO was extended several times and the latest phase of Recovery MCO (RMCO) will last until 31 August 2020. As seafood represents an important protein source, the aquaculture sector supports the livelihood of coastal communities in Malaysia, particularly those involved in micro- and small-scale fish farming activities. The emergence and spread of this pandemic severely disrupt market demand and supply chains of seafood industries. Therefore, this case report looks into the potential impacts of COVID-19 on the aquaculture sector of Malaysia. Then, the coping strategies implemented by Malaysia are highlighted and their potential effectiveness is discussed. Also, some useful recommendations are suggested to ensure the continuity and growth of the aquaculture sector.

A.","This review paper discusses some of the challenges on the effects of COVID-19 on aquaculture and fisheries and their mitigations and strategies in ASEAN perspectives with special emphasis on Malaysia due to significant impacts of COVID-19 occurred in this country’s enormous aquaculture and fishing industries. Substantial factors within fishery systems, as well as ecological and social impacts outside their control, such as climate change, chronic pollution, resource degradation, fluctuating commodity prices and changes in management strategies that can asymmetrically affect different communities, stress fish culturists and fisher-folk communities. COVID-19’s broken food supply chain and shrinking market have certainly impacted everyone in the fishing and aquaculture business, with small-scale fishermen being the most susceptible. During COVID-19 pandemic in ASEAN countries, it was discovered that the potential effects on agricultural sectors in Malaysia needed to be protected in order to defend the well-being of farmers, breeders, fishers, and workers, the majority of whom are low-income earners. The relevant authorities have created different supply chains and expand supply sources to maintain revenue in the event of a national economic downturn through traditional marketing channels. The Post COVID-19 monitoring should be undertaken as a model role based on the Malaysian scenario to gain a quick grasp of the food security and livelihood situation of all fishing communities. As a result, a national platform is urgently needed to boost production, supply, and marketing integration so that the fisheries and aquaculture products may be traded efficiently. Nevertheless, transparency in policy responses, as well as regional and international cooperation, will support to build trust in the future of fish value chains and markets. Furthermore, these real-world lessons will make it easier to learn from the pandemic crisis to improve the sustainability and viability of fisheries and aquaculture industries in ASEAN countries and global as well. © 2021 Desalination Publications.

"170","IMPLICATIONS OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON HOUSEHOLD FOOD SECURITY: EXPERIENCE FROM SARAWAK, MALAYSIA","Abdullah, Regina Garai; Mersat, Neilson Ilan; Swee-Kiong, Wong","This paper discusses how household food security is affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, using examples from Sarawak, Malaysia. Food security in Sarawak was affected by the implementation of the Movement Control Order (MCO) that was introduced to curb the spread of the Covid-19 disease. The MCO, and the subsequent phases that followed, imposed a varying degree of restrictions on movements in the country. This measure had serious repercussions on food security as it affects the distribution of food as well as how people access food. This raises questions of how secure households are in terms of food security, how do they ensure food security for their households and what are their greatest challenge in ensuring food security. This paper seeks to address those questions by examining the experiences and perceptions on food security during the pandemic based on the responses of 235 respondents. Findings indicated that most households are food secure i.e. having similar access to food as prior to MCO and have not skipped any meals. In order to achieve this, households had to resort to various measures including switching their food sources, shopping online, and going without their preferred food. Significantly, the finding shows that food security means more than just having enough food but should also incorporate elements of variety, types and quantity of food. It also shows that the greatest challenge in achieving and maintaining household food security lies in the way household cope with the changes brought, both directly and indirectly, by the pandemic.

H.","COVID-19 cases have now been confirmed in every country in the world, and to slow the spread of the virus, the World Health Organization (WHO) has urged infected countries to impose several containment and suppression measures. Supply chain disruptions are among one of the most vulnerable food sector caused by the aspects of COVID-19 disease control (i.e., lockdown, travel restriction, or movement control order (MCO)). Thus, the main purpose of this paper is to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on marine food security supply chain and management in Malaysia. To achieve this, the study systematically and specifically addresses the following objectives: (i) to review available literature on Southeast Asia food supply management and COVID-19; (ii) to conduct a survey on purchasing method preferences and perception on marine fish supplies availability; and (iii) to recommend relevant intervention and policy development to improve well-being and livelihood status among the study population. The national survey was conducted from June 1 to September 30, 2020 through Google Forms. The results from the systematic review showed that there are eight main articles within the research areas of COVID-19 and supply chain, which have been focused only in the Southeast Asia region. The web survey results indicated that the self-visit methods for marine fish supplies were the main methods before the COVID-19 pandemic, and were decreased during the MCO period. The study also indicated that the respondents genders and types of living area affected their perceptions of marine fish supplies sources and distribution. Additionally, some respondents decided to use delivery services as well as booking and purchasing via phone and online, which includes the use of social media. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",2021,"Advances in Food Security and Sustainability","6","","169-210",NA,"10.1016/bs.af2s.2021.08.002","Asia"

S.","INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) isolation has altered individuals' food purchasing behaviour and dietary intake patterns. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the changes in dietary intake patterns and their impacts on the weight status of young adults in Malaysia during the COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved 1045 young adults in Malaysia. The changes in dietary intake patterns were assessed using the Dietary Diversity Questionnaire with slight modifications, while anthropometric measurements including body height, body weight before the pandemic and current body weight were self-reported. RESULTS: Overall, nearly half of the respondents (48.8%) gained weight during the confinement, with an average increment of 4.06 ± 3.23 kg. Of 1045, 45.3% reported consuming more fruits and 60.2% had higher plain water intake during the pandemic. It is observed that 41.0% to 66.8% of the young adults changed their dietary intake patterns during the pandemic. Increased consumption in cereals and grains (β = 0.084, p = 0.015, 95% CI = 0.017-0.160), as well as oils and fats (β = 0.123, p = 0.001, 95% CI = 0.059-0.241), was positively associated with weight gain during the pandemic. On the contrary, an increased plain water intake was negatively associated with weight gain during the lockdown (β = -0.100, p = 0.003, 95% CI = -0.171--0.034). Findings in the current study also suggested that cutting back cereals and grains (β = 0.156, p < 0.001, 95% CI = 0.122-0.288), as well as oils and fats (β = 0.091, p = 0.012, 95% CI = 0.022-0.183), contributed significantly to weight loss during the pandemic confinement. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the enforcement of the Movement Control Order (MCO) drove up the prevalence of overweight/obesity among young adults in Malaysia. Increased consumption of cereals and grains and oils and fats contributed to weight gain in the pandemic lockdown. Nonetheless, a noticeable proportion of young adults in Malaysia shifted to a healthier food choice by increasing the consumption of fruits and vegetables.",2022,"Nutrients","14","2","",35057460,"10.3390/nu14020280","Asia"

This report highlights potential risks faced by their agri-food sectors due to the COVID-19 pandemic and outlines the responses and policy actions each member is taking to address threats to food security and prevent hunger. Research Method: Publicly available information was synthesized, and insights from 19 individuals working in agriculture or agri-food-related areas in the public or private sectors or academia in APO member countries were obtained. Findings: Imminent, medium-and long-term food security challenges due to COVID-19 vary among APO member countries. However, through the implementation of key policies, many stress the need for critical agricultural inputs, such as fertilizers and safe, quality seeds, to meet seasonal crop calendars. The longer COVID-19 containment measures stay in place, the more challenging the recovery process will be for ensuring smooth food production, accessibility to staple food and nutrition and trade among countries.

Heterogeneous effects among households are observed. Fifty‐one percent of the sample households experienced income loss from various livelihood activities, and landless households were more severely affected by the crisis, mainly because of lost farm and nonfarm employment and negative impacts on rural enterprises. Women and men in these landless households were equally engaged and affected by lower wages or more difficulties in finding farm work; fewer women were engaged in nonfarm work, but almost all of them lost such nonfarm wage employment. Women in landless households are also particularly vulnerable in terms of worsened workload and increased tension in the household during COVID‐19. Landed households were also affected through lower prices, lower demand for crops, and difficulties in input access. Women and men differ in levels of stress, fear, and pessimism regarding the effects of COVID‐19. In most households, there were no signs that household task‐sharing and work balance improved, and no clear shift in intrahousehold relations was observed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

"175","Impacts of COVID-19 on agricultural production and food systems in late transforming Southeast Asia: The case of Myanmar","Boughton, D.; Goeb, J.; Lambrecht, I.; Headey, D.; Takeshima, H.; Mahrt, K.; Masias, I.; Goudet, S.; Ragasa, C.; Maredia, M. K.; Minten, B.; Diao, X.","The objective of this contribution is to report the initial impacts of measures taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic on Myanmar's agri-food system. Myanmar is one of several late-transforming low-income countries in Southeast Asia where agriculture still plays a large role in rural livelihoods, and where food prices are a key factor affecting nutrition security for poor urban and rural households. Whereas the economic impacts of COVID-19 disruptions on tourism and manufacturing were obvious to policymakers, the impacts on the agri-food system were less evident and often more indirect. This resulted in the rural sector being allocated only a very small share of the government's initial fiscal response to mitigate the economic impacts of COVID-19. To correct this information gap, a suite of phone surveys covering a wide spectrum of actors in the agri-food system were deployed, including farm input suppliers, mechanization service providers, farmers, commodity traders, millers, food retailers and consumers. The surveys were repeated at regular intervals prior to and during the main crop production season which began shortly after nationwide COVID-19 prevention measures were implemented in April. While the results indicate considerable resilience in the agri-food system in response to the initial disruptions, persistent financial stress for a high proportion of households and agri-food system businesses indicate that the road to a full recovery will take time. The experience provides important lessons for strengthening the resilience of the agri-food system, and the livelihoods of households that depend on it. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2021,"Agricultural Systems","188","","",NA,"10.1016/j.agsy.2020.103026","Asia"
"176","Impacts of COVID-19 on Myanmar's chicken and egg sector, with implications for the sustainable development goals","Fang, P.; Belton, B.; Zhang, X.; Ei Win, H.","CONTEXT: Chicken and eggs make important contributions to the food and nutrition security of low-income households in Myanmar, making it important to understand the impacts of COVID-19 on Myanmar's poultry sector. OBJECTIVE: First, we evaluate the responsiveness and resilience of different chicken and egg farming systems in Myanmar to the shock of COVID-19. Second, we evaluate implications of the performance of the chicken and egg sector during COVID-19 for the Sustainable Development Goals. METHODS: We conducted six waves of telephone interviews from June to November 2020 with 269 chicken farms close to Yangon. We compared impacts in two types of production system - broilers and layers - using a survey of the same farms conducted in 2019 as a baseline. For each type of farm, we compared ‘integrated’ and ‘non-integrated’ farms, where integration involves combining production of chickens and fish. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: First, the COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted chicken and egg production. More than 30% of broiler farms and 10% of layer farms closed before June, 42% of long-term farmworkers were laid off, and indicators of business sentiment were much more pessimistic than in 2019. Second, the sector experienced a V-shaped recovery until September 2020 when a second wave of COVID-19 hit Myanmar. Third, the impacts of COVID-19 vary by production system. Broiler farms have a much shorter production cycle than layer farms and were able rapidly adjust operational status by closing or reopening, whereas very few layer farms reopened after closing. Fourth, integrated layer-fish farms proved more resilient to the shock of COVID-19 than layer farms, with 90% of layer-fish farms and 76% of layer farms remaining operational in November, but there was no difference in the performance of broiler-fish and broiler farms. Fifth, the slow supply response of layer farms has meant higher egg prices for consumers, likely affecting nutritional intakes and making it more difficult for Myanmar to achieve the second Sustainable Development Goal of ending hunger and malnutrition by 2030. SIGNIFICANCE: The results contribute to understanding of the challenges faced by chicken farms in Myanmar during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the effectiveness of their adaptive responses. Results have implications for other countries in Asia where integrated livestock-fish farms are common, and other developing countries where the poultry sector is expanding rapidly. © 2021 The Author(s)",2021,"Agricultural Systems","190","","",NA,"10.1016/j.agsy.2021.103094","Asia"

Through a careful review of the news reports, social media, and NGO reports and press releases, three significant themes emerged: employment disruptions due to seafood system instabilities; travel or mobility restrictions; and poor access to services such as health care or social programs. We unpack each theme in turn to spotlight the impacts COVID-19 is having on yet another vulnerable worker population, fish workers. We further reflect on what this pandemic reveals about unacceptable work in industrial fisheries and consider if the pandemic may be producing opportunities to advocate for better working conditions. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2021,"Maritime Studies","20","1","87-99",NA,"10.1007/s40152-020-00205-y","Asia"

K.; Sah, L. K.; Karki, K.; Sah, R. K.","BACKGROUND: Food insecurity is a serious social and public health problem which is exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic especially in resource-poor countries such as Nepal. However, there is a paucity of evidence at local levels. This study aims to explore food insecurity among people from the disadvantaged community and low-income families during the COVID-19 pandemic in Province-2 of Nepal. METHODS: The semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted virtually among purposively selected participants (n = 41) from both urban and rural areas in eight districts of Province 2 in Nepal. All the interviews were conducted in the local language between July and August 2020. The data analysis was performed using thematic network analysis in Nvivo 12 Pro software. RESULTS: The results of this study are grouped into four global themes: i) Impact of COVID-19 on food security; ii) Food insecurity and coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic, iii) Food relief and emergency support during the COVID-19 pandemic, and iv) Impact of COVID-19 and food insecurity on health and wellbeing. Most participants in the study expressed that families from low socioeconomic backgrounds and disadvantaged communities such as those working on daily wages and who rely on remittance had experienced increased food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants used different forms of coping strategies to meet their food requirements during the pandemic. Community members experienced favouritism, nepotism, and partiality from local politicians and authorities during the distribution of food relief. The food insecurity among low-income and disadvantaged families has affected their health and wellbeing making them increasingly vulnerable to the COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: Food insecurity among low-income and disadvantaged families was found to be a serious problem during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study suggests that the relief support plan and policies should be focused on the implementation of immediate sustainable food security strategies to prevent hunger, malnutrition, and mental health problems among the most vulnerable groups in the community.",2021,"PLoS ONE","16","7","e0254954",34288965,"10.1371/journal.pone.0254954","Asia"

M.","The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced a new battle in human history for a safe and fearless life. Therefore, this cross-sectional survey was conducted (Punjab, Pakistan) on healthy recovered, home quarantined COVID-19 patients to draw conclusive health support guidelines in the fight against this pandemic. COVID-19 recovered patients (n = 80) of age ≥14 years were randomly selected during the period November 2020 to February 2021. A nutrition and lifestyle changes questionnaire, containing ten sections and seventy questions, was completed through the telephone/WhatsApp. Data were transferred into an Excel spreadsheet and statistically analyzed by applying chi-square, correlation, and a t test of independent values using SPSS-16 software. The patients had an age range of 14 to 80 years, of which 52 (65%) were male and 28 (35%) were female, and 32 (40%) had a normal BMI. The patients had a peak COVID-19 recovery period of 2 weeks, and a mean recovery period of 2.8 ± 1.4 weeks. Certain variables, including gender (males), age (>40 years), sleep (≤5 hr), less/no physical activity, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and autoimmune diseases, were significantly associated with delayed recovery. Poor nutritional outcomes, including lower intakes of water, legumes, nuts, meat, and milk/yogurt; and higher consumption of fast/fried/junk/spicy foods and cold water/drinks, were also significantly associated with a longer recovery period. The results were similar for not taking daily doses of multivitamins, and vitamins C, D, E, and zinc. This study identified that staying physically active, maintaining sensible body weight, having a sleep of 7 hr, consuming more foods of plant origin especially plant-based proteins from nuts and legumes, taking supplemental doses of multivitamins, vitamin D, E, and zinc, along with drinking ≥2 L of water daily can provide a significant role in early and safe recovery from COVID-19.",2021,"Food Sci Nutr","9","9","5036-59",34518779,"10.1002/fsn3.2458","Asia"

B.; Khan, S. N.; Dilawar, A.; Al-Ansari, N.","The strict lockdown measures not only contributed to curbing the spread of COVID-19 infection, but also improved the environmental conditions worldwide. The main goal of the current study was to investigate the co-benefits of COVID-19 lockdown on the atmosphere and aquatic ecological system under restricted anthropogenic activities in South Asia. The remote sensing data (a) NO2 emissions from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), (b) Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and (c) chlorophyll (Chl-a) and turbidity data from MODIS-Aqua Level-3 during Jan–Oct (2020) were analyzed to assess the changes in air and water pollution compared to the last five years (2015–2019). The interactions between the air and water pollution were also investigated using overland runoff and precipitation in 2019 and 2020 at a monthly scale to investigate the anomalous events, which could affect the N loading to coastal regions. The results revealed a considerable drop in the air and water pollution (30–40% reduction in NO2 emissions, 45% in AOD, 50% decline in coastal Chl-a concentration, and 29% decline in turbidity) over South Asia. The rate of reduction in NO2 emissions was found the highest for Lahore (32%), New Delhi (31%), Ahmadabad (29%), Karachi (26%), Hyderabad (24%), and Chennai (17%) during the strict lockdown period from Apr–Jun, 2020. A positive correlation between AOD and NO2 emissions (0.23–0.50) implies that a decrease in AOD is attributed to a reduction in NO2. It was observed that during strict lockdown, the turbidity has decreased by 29%, 11%, 16%, and 17% along the coastal regions of Karachi, Mumbai, Calcutta, and Dhaka, respectively, while a 5–6% increase in turbidity was seen over the Madras during the same period. The findings stress the importance of reduced N emissions due to halted fossil fuel consumption and their relationships with the reduced air and water pollution. It is concluded that the atmospheric and hydrospheric environment can be improved by implementing smart restrictions on fossil fuel consumption with a minimum effect on socioeconomics in the region. Smart constraints on fossil fuel usage are recommended to control air and water pollution even after the social and economic activities resume business-as-usual scenario. © 2021 The Author(s).

A.; Bashir, B.; Li, L.; Wang, D.; Tao, Y.","The novel infectious disease (COVID-19) took only a few weeks from its official inception in December 2019 to become a global pandemic in early 2020. Countries across the world went to lockdown, and various strict measures were implemented to reduce the further spread of the infection. Although, the strict lockdown measures were aimed at stopping the spread of COVID-19, however, Its positive implications were also observed for the environmental conditions across the global regions. The present study attempted to explore the eco-restoration of coastal marine system in response to reduced deposition of atmospheric nitrogen (NO2) emission during the substantial shift in human activities across the global metropolitan cities. Remotely data of NO2 emission were taken from Ozone Monitoring Instrument and the coastal water quality along the marine system was estimated from MODIS-Aqua Level-3 using Semi-Analytic Sediment Model (SASM). The changes in tropospheric NO2 in 2020s were also compared with the long-term average changes over the baseline period 2015 − 2019. A significant reduction in anthropogenic mobility (85 − 90%) has been observed in almost all countries over different places, especially grocery, parks, workplaces, and transit stations. A massive reduction in tropospheric NO2 was detected in Wuhan (53%), Berlin (42%), London (41%), Karachi (40%), Paris (38%), Santiago (35%), and Chennai (34%) during the strict lockdown period of the early 2020 as compared to the last five years. However, after the partial lockdown was lifted, tropospheric NO2 values bounced back and slightly increased over Karachi (6%) and Bremen (12%). For water turbidity, the rate of reduction was found to be the highest along the different coastal regions of the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea (51%), West Atlantic Ocean (32%), East Atlantic Ocean (29%), and Indian Ocean (21%) from Apr to Jun 2020. The monthly comparison of overland-runoff in 2020 compared to 2019 across the different costal watersheds indicates that the observed decline in turbidity might have been due to the reduced deposition of atmospheric nitrogen. The findings of this study suggest that the recent decline in tropospheric NO2 and water turbidity might be associated with reduced emissions from fossil fuels and road transports followed by COVID-19 forced restrictions in the twenty-first century. The inferences made here highlight the hope of improving the global environmental quality by reducing greenhouse gas emissions using innovative periodic confinement measures on heavy transport and industries while securing public health and socioeconomics. © 2021 The Author(s).

K.; Schlüter, A.","The Covid-19 pandemic is a global shock that is significantly affecting coastal social-ecological systems (SES) in different parts of the world. Its widespread impacts have unravelled vulnerabilities in many aspects of society, including food systems. Our study investigated the impacts of a lockdown associated with the pandemic in the province of Bulacan, in the region of Central Luzon, Philippines, where aquaculture and capture fisheries are important and interconnected sectors. In particular, we focused on impacts related to production and market. We considered people’s coping strategies and the factors that enabled such strategies. Our investigation adopted a case study approach and drew on qualitative data analysed through thematic analysis. The findings revealed differentiated mechanisms through which aquaculture and capture fisheries production were impacted. Both were strongly affected by market disruptions but through slightly different ways. In effect, the lockdown provided the impetus for the uptake and spreading of practices that were previously peripheral, particularly in relation to market exchanges. The study also identified a variety of coping strategies, as well as the importance of social support in the form of food aid, financial assistance, and institutional livelihood assistance. Finally, it discusses the importance of diversity in food sources, the role of local food systems, and governance implications for foregrounding social-ecological resilience in short-term response and long-term recovery. © 2021, The Author(s).",2021,"Maritime Studies","20","1","75-85",NA,"10.1007/s40152-021-00213-6","Asia"

E.; Macusi, E. S.; Calderon, M. N.; Bersaldo, M. J. I.; Digal, L. N.","COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in 2020 with countries putting up several measures to mitigate and flatten the curve of hospitalizations and death from travel bans to home confinements and local lockdowns. This pandemic created health and economic crises, leading to increased incidence of poverty and food crisis especially on both agriculture and the fisheries in many developing nations including the Philippines. The specific objectives of this study were to assess the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of small-scale fishers and to determine what factors could influence the volume of their catch during this time of pandemic. Moreover, this also investigated the impact of COVID-19 restrictions to fishers and their families. To do that we surveyed N = 200 small-scale fishers around the Davao gulf using semi-structured questionnaire and inquired on the impact of the COVID-19 to their fishing operation, catch, fishing costs, and their families. The collected socioeconomic variables, including emotional responses to the pandemic were then related to the CPUE and the volume of catch. The results show that fishers were highly affected by the pandemic due to the lockdown policy imposed in the fishing villages during the earlier phases of restrictions by the government. Fishers were affected in terms of the volume of their catch, also fishing costs, and emotionally as they were also frustrated due to the impacts of the hard lockdown. The restricted fishing access was found to have important and major set-back on the fishing operations of fishers and the same was experienced also by the middlemen given the low fish price and reduced mobility of the fish traders. COVID-19 also impacted the fishers, and their families through lack of mobility, food inadequacy, travel restrictions and their children’s education.

R.","A quantitative descriptive strategy was applied to identify food patterns for Filipino consumers before, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Sampling was carried out using simple random sampling techniques. An electronic-questionnaire served as primary research instrument and was distributed through social media platforms to which 80 out of 250 responses were selected. Simple quantitative analysis such as mean value, frequency distribution and percentage were utilized. Results showed that the most of the respondent’s diet has wellness, social and psychological influence. Organic diet desires and self-cooking practices are continuing to grow. The study also showed that the essential aspects of food choice, health, quality and safety are increasingly being taken into account. The COVID-19 pandemic shifted the habits of food intake to healthier, influencing even the preference of consumed food. Thus, this study can be used as a theoretical guide especially for factors influencing the eating patterns during a pandemic. Ergo, food establishments can make use of the results to strategize to combat the COVID-19 pandemic by improving product quality on the basis of consumer needs and demands. © 2021, Intelektual Pustaka Media Utama.

A questionnaire developed by the researcher was used to gather data with Cronbach Alpha of 0.91. t-test, ANOVA, and Fleiss kappa were performed to treat data. There were no significant differences between self-reported FSP in four dimensions and demographic characteristics, except for age, where a significant difference exists between the FSP of the four age groups along food preparation (F ​= ​4.530, ρ <0.01). The FSP in the four dimensions obtained a weighted x¯ and σ of 1.72 ​± ​0.69 which is interpreted as Sometimes Practiced. The food handlers at home inadequately and inappropriately practiced the protocols in keeping the food safe to eat. The observed reports showed that the food handlers at home do not meet food safety standards as indicated in the weighted x¯ and σ in the four dimensions 1.63 ± 0.11, with a description of Sometimes Practiced. Observed practices further show very poor adherence to guidelines. Test for inter-rater reliability yielded almost perfect agreement (κ ​= ​0.81, ρ <0.05).

D.; Rafon, J. K. A.; Macusi, E. S.","Understanding the disruption of fishing activities due to COVID-19 and closed fishing season can provide an immediate reference for policy directions that help the government direct its resources to the most affected agricultural sectors. This study examined the impact of COVID-19 and closed fishing season on the commercial fishers' fishing operation and economic well-being in Davao Gulf, Mindanao. A total of N = 66 commercial fishers, 33 ringnet and 33 bagnet fishers were interviewed one-on-one in their homes and in the landing sites using a semi-structured questionnaire. Data was further validated using four focus groups in the study areas (N = 55). The findings of the study showed that the average catch per fishing trip for ringnet and bagnet fishers were 1,719 kg and 417 kg. The common catch species of ringnets were bigeye scad (Selar crumenophthalmus), bullet tuna (Auxis rochei), roundscad (Decapterus macrosoma), skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis), and yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares). While the common catch species of bagnet fishers were roundscad (Decapterus macrosoma), Bali sardinella (Sardinella lemuru), moonfish (Mene maculata), short mackerel (Rastrelliger brachysoma), anchovy (Engrulidae), and bigeye scad (Selar crumenophthalmus). Both types of fishers operated at the height of the pandemic but met difficulties selling the fish due to travel restrictions. Thus, they had lesser income. Other impacts include disruption in their children's education, feeling fearful and frustrated. In addition, during the closed fishing season, the bagnet fishers find alternative livelihoods such as hired labor and construction. In contrast, ringnet fishers fish beyond the Davao Gulf and continue to do so until the closed fishing season ends. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2022,"Ocean and Coastal Management","217","","",NA,"10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.105997","Asia"

D.; Sivapalan, S.","Apart from the health aspects and the high death toll, the COVID-19 pandemic has, since its official recognition in March 2020 caused may social and economic problems. It has also led to many environmental ones. For instance, the lockdowns have led to higher levels of consumption of packaged products, and of take-away food. This paper reports on an international study on the increased consumption and subsequent changes in the amounts of waste produced since the COVID-19 pandemic. The results show that 45-48% of the respondents observed an increased consumption of packed food, fresh food, and food delivery. One of the main reasons for the increased waste generation during the lockdown was the fact that people have spent more time at home. In addition, increases of 43% and 53% in food waste and plastic packaging. Drawing from comparisons on the amount of domestic waste produced before and during the pandemic, the findings suggest that some specific types of municipal waste have visibly increased, putting additional pressure on waste management systems. This characterises one of non-intended effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results from this study provide useful insights to city administrations and municipal utilities on consumption patterns during emergency situations. This, in turn, may support more systemic and strategic measures to be taken, so as to curtail the increase of household waste during pandemic situations.",2021,"Sci Total Environ","777","","145997",33676209,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145997","Asia"

As these island states grow economically, diet diversification by an increasingly affluent population demands a balance between food imports and self-production. Singapore, a wealthy, small island state has consistently been ranked high in food security in international comparisons, but only under conditions when trade is uninhibited and countries do not reduce food exports. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown vulnerabilities in the country's ""Resilience"" strategy to maintain food security through importing over 90% of its food needs from over 170 countries. Leading up to and during the pandemic, strategic policy initiatives were announced by the government and new measures were taken to increase the stability of imports, ramp up production from existing farms, increase self-production by 300% by 2030 through increasing the number of high technology urban vegetable and fish farms, and factory-cultured food, and reducing food waste.

A.","The maritime industry plays a key role in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as an effort to combat the global issue of climate change. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) is targeting a 50% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050 compared to 2008. To measure Singapore's progress towards this target, we have conducted a comprehensive analysis of carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions from the Western Singapore Straits based on the voyage data from Automatic Identification System (AIS) and static information from Singapore Maritime Data Hub (SG-MDH). Two methodologies, the MEET and TRENDS frameworks were applied to estimate the emission volume per vessel per hour.

N.; Ramba, T.; Raimundo, I.; Sulejmanović, N.; Swanby, H.; Tevera, D.; Stöber, S.","The COVID-19 outbreak forced governments to make decisions that had adverse effects on local food systems and supply chains. As a result, many small-scale food producers faced difficulties growing, harvesting, and selling their goods. This participatory research examines local small-scale farmers’ challenges as farmers but also as consumers and their coping strategies during the month of April and one week in June 2020. The study was initiated and conceptualized in collaboration with small-scale farmer members of an existing research network in selected urban and rural areas in South Africa, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Indonesia. Participants co-designed the research, collected and uploaded data through digital survey tools, and contributed to data analysis and interpretation. A common observation across regions is that the measures imposed in response to COVID-19 highlighted and partly exacerbated existing socio-economic inequalities among food system actors. Strict lockdowns in Cape Town, South Africa, and Masvingo, Zimbabwe, significantly restricted the production capacity of small-scale farmers in the informal economy and created more food insecurity for them. In Maputo, Mozambique, and Toraja and Java, Indonesia, local food systems continued to operate and were even strengthened by higher social capital and adaptive capacities. © 2020 by the authors.

G.","Sri Lanka is one of the leading ornamental fish exporters globally, with total export earnings of around 15 million USD in 2019. The novel human coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has become a great threat to many industries worldwide, including the ornamental fish trade. The present study was conducted to explore the qualitative and quantitative impacts of the pandemic on the ornamental fish supply chain in the Western Province of Sri Lanka with a sample size of 100 respondents representing the key stakeholders of the supply chain. The results concluded that all the stakeholders experienced a negative impact on their business process with the ongoing pandemic. There was a general reduction in sales and along the supply chain, the fish exporters were the least affected sector(7% reduction), followed by breeders and growers (31%), and aquarium fish dealers (38%). The stakeholders who handled a diversified fish stock managed to do better than those who dealt with a single fish species during the pandemic. The supply offish feeds was one of the significant constraints for all the stakeholders during a complete and partial lockdown. As a positive outcome of the pandemic, 30% of the fish exporters received an unexpected increased number of export orders from their buyers. Government intervention is crucial to rebuild and strengthen the impacted key players within the ornamental fish supply chain under the pandemic situation. © 2021, Asian Fisheries Society.

"194","A Framework for Addressing the Twin Challenges of COVID-19 and Climate Change for Sustainable Agriculture and Food Security in South Asia","Rasul, G.","Climate change has begun to ravage agriculture and threaten food security in many parts of the world. The novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has further disrupted agricultural activities and supply chains and has become a serious threat for public health. Like in many developing countries, South Asian farmers are now facing the double challenge of addressing the impacts of a changing climate and managing the disruptions caused by COVID-19. Despite growing concern, there is limited understanding of how climate change, public health, and COVID-19 interact, and of the possible pathways to achieving a climate-friendly recovery from COVID-19 to achieve food and nutrition security. In view of this, this paper explores the multifaceted challenges that farmers are now facing in South Asia due to climate change and the disruption caused by COVID-19 from the agricultural and food security lens. The analysis reveals that the complex interactions of COVID-19 and climate change have impacted all dimensions of food security. These interlinkages demand an integrated approach in dealing with food, public health, and climate change to harness synergies and minimize trade-offs between food production, public health, and climate mitigation. I present a framework to address the immediate challenge of COVID-19 and the longer-term challenge of anthropogenic climate change. Key elements of the framework include the strengthening health sector response capacities, strengthening of local and regional food systems, making agriculture resilient to pandemics, adopting flexible and smart approaches—including the implementation of climate-smart agricultural interventions on different scales, promotion of appropriate research and innovation, and the integration of short-term support to address the challenges of COVID-19 to build long-term productivity, and resilience of food systems by investing on natural capital. This framework would enable policy makers to choose the appropriate policy responses at different scales, to address these twin challenges of COVID-19 and climate change. © Copyright © 2021 Rasul.",2021,"Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems","5","","",NA,"10.3389/fsufs.2021.679037","Asia"

H.","The present study examined the impact on island tourism development during the COVID-19 epidemic environment and infection risk by using Penghu as a case study. Using a mixed re-search methodology, 534 questionnaires were collected and analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics 22.0 for Windows statistical software with statistical tests and t-tests. The views of scholars, experts, residents, and tourists on the questionnaire results were then compiled and finally examined by multivariate validation analysis. The results showed that different stakeholders maintained different perspectives on a number of economic, social, and environmental issues in the epidemic environment with risks of infection. Residents considered that the preservation of marine culture and the lack of resting and parking facilities for tourists are the issues that need to be improved in the development of Penghu tourism. Visitors believe that improving littering, vessel mooring space, pollution from heavy oil discharges, landscape and historic site protection, surface litter and pollution in the harbor, marine habitat, heavy oil spills, tourist litter, and threats from invasive species will help attract tourists to visit and spend money. © 2021 by the author.

"196","Marine resource recovery in Southern Thailand during COVID-19 and policy recommendations","Israngkura, A.","COVID-19 and subsequent government health containment measures have slowed down economic activities worldwide, particularly tourism. With the number of foreign tourists entering Thailand during 2020 and 2021 greatly diminished, the number of tourists at marine and coastal attractions in Southern Thailand has declined as well. This study found evidence of a relationship between the decline of the number of tourists and marine resource recovery. This recovery appears in the form of cleaner beaches, clearer seawater and increased sighting of marine animals. Between 2020 and 2021, official reports found increased sighting of dugongs, dolphins, blacktip reef sharks, whale sharks, leopard sharks, sea turtles, green turtles, hawksbill turtles, and false killer whales at marine national parks in Southern Thailand. The study also found that, prior to the COVD-19 outbreak, the number of tourists at Patong Beach and Maya Bay exceeded their tourism carrying capacities. Finally, this study proposes eight policy measures related to tourism management for marine resource sustainability: conservation and recreation zoning, enforcing marine park closure, redesigning marine park entrance fee systems, ensuring adequate recreational facilities, stricter enforcement of the law, promoting alternative tourism sites, encouraging more inclusivity and participation in decision making processes, and enhancing public awareness.",2022,"Mar Policy","137","","104972",35125620,"10.1016/j.marpol.2022.104972","Asia"

Ko Yo is one of the tourist attractions in Songkhla province due to its unique culture, environment, and businesses. The lockdown has changed the local lifestyle together with its socioeconomic and environmental impacts. This study aimed to integrally investigate the impacts of the COVID-19 related societal responses on the coastal environment and activities and the adaptive capacity of businesses on Ko Yo Island in Songkhla province. The results showed negative impacts of the COVID-19 on restaurants, homestays, and aquaculture businesses due to the Governmental emergency decrees. Aquaculture was the most affected business. Despite the reduced number of customers and transportation problems, some restaurants and homestays have provided delivery services and fishing areas as novel services available to their customers. The decrease in coastal activities had positively affected some environmental parameters, e.g., total nitrogen, total phosphorus, dissolved oxygen, and biochemical oxygen demand in water. In conclusion, businesses in Ko Yo were vulnerable to the disruption and the COVID-19 related situation. The local government organizations should seek to support the local communities, active businesses, and people in need to increase their adaptive capacities by providing financial support, organizing career development workshops, and coordinating and counseling local people. Short and long terms of emergency measures should be set at upper levels of government. © 2021, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.",2021,"Applied Ecology and Environmental Research","19","4","2815-2828",NA,"10.15666/aeer/1904_28152828","Asia"
"199","Impact of covid-19 on food and plastic waste generated by consumers in bangkok","Liu, C.; Bunditsakulchai, P.; Zhuo, Q.","The crisis ignited by COVID-19 has transformed the volume and composition of waste generation and requires a dynamic response from policy makers. This study selected Bangkok as a case study to semi-quantitatively examine the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on consumer-generated food and plastic waste by examining changes in lifestyles and consumption behaviour through a face-to-face questionnaire survey. Travel bans and diminished economic activity due to COVID-19 have led to a dramatic reduction in waste from the business sector and in the total amount of municipal waste generated. However, the results of the survey showed that both food and plastic waste generated by households in Bangkok increased during COVID-19. The shift from eating out to online food delivery services led to an increase in plastic bags, hot-and-cold food bags, plastic food containers, and food waste. Reasons for the increase in household food waste during COVID-19 varied, with respondents citing excessive amounts of food and unappetising taste, followed by exceeding the expiration date and rotting/foul odours. These reasons may be the result of the inability to predict quantity and quality when ordering online, and inadequate food planning and management by consumers. To achieve more effective food and plastic waste management, home delivery services, consumer food planning and management, and the formation of a circular economy based on localised supply chains may be considered as important intervention points. © 2021 by the authors.

"200","Food and beverage stocks responding to COVID-19","Phuong, L. C. M.","This paper investigated how food and beverage (F&B) stocks react to COVID-19. The event study method was applied to four events, including the first and second events were the first COVID-19 positive patients detected in the largest and second-largest economic center of Vietnam. The third and fourth events are related to strong measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19: The nationwide lockdown at the beginning of the second quarter of 2020, and the lockdown of Danang at the beginning of the third quarter of 2020. The results show that the reaction of F&B stock prices to events supports the semi-strong form of efficient market theory. The strong and lasting negative reaction of F&B stocks to the first event can be explained by surprise (first case in Vietnam) and Hochiminh city's economic engine driving role in the development of Vietnam's economy. The study finds that heuristic decision-making from nationwide lockdowns (suppression of supply chains during lockdowns) can explain the sub-sector of farming-fishing-ranching products reacted more strongly to the lockdown event in Danang.

METHODS: An online survey was conducted at 15 hospitals and health centers from 6-19 April 2020. Data of 2299 front-line HCWs were analyzed-including socio-demographics, symptoms like COVID-19, health literacy, eHealth literacy, DDL, HES, fear of COVID-19, changes in mental health, and HRQoL. Regression models were used to examine the associations. RESULTS: HCWs with higher scores of DDL and HES had lower scores of FCoV-19S (regression coefficient, B, -0.04; 95% confidence interval, 95% CI, -0.07, -0.02; p = 0.001; and B, -0.10; 95% CI, -0.15, -0.06; p < 0.001); had a higher likelihood of stable or better mental health status (odds ratio, OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.00, 1.05; p = 0.029; and OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.00, 1.07; p = 0.043); and HRQoL (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01, 1.03; p = 0.006; and OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02, 1.06; p = 0.001), respectively.

A.; Raz, O.; Kaufman-Shriqui, V.","The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has been associated with both increased anxiety, deterioration in diet and weight gain. These associations may differ by sex. The present report examines differences by sex in diet quality in order to determine whether associations between diet and psychological stress during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic differed by sex. This online study is available internationally in seven languages. The Mediterranean Diet Score was used to measure diet quality, while the General Anxiety Disorder 7-point scale (GAD-7) was used to measure anxiety. Findings were compared by self-reported sex (male vs. female). A total of 3797 respondents provided informed consent and met eligibility criteria, of whom 526 women were omitted due to being pregnant or six months or less post-partum, or due to reproductive status not being reported. Thus, 3271 individuals are included in the present report, of whom 71.2% were women. The median age of women was 30 (interquartile range (IQR) = 16) years vs. 31 (IQR = 19) years, p = 0.079. The median diet quality score was 9 (IQ = 3) in both women and men (p = 0.75). Despite the overall similarity in diet score, several components of the score differed significantly by sex. Women reported consuming significantly more olive oil, daily servings of vegetables, and weekly servings of sweet baked goods. Men reported consuming significantly more sweetened/carbonated drinks, red meat, alcohol, legumes, and hummus/tahini. Women reported a GAD-7 score of 6 (IQR = 8), while men reported 3 (6), p < 0.001. An inverse association was detected between the Mediterranean diet score and the GAD-7 score in both women (rho = -0.166, p < 0.001) and men (rho = -0.154, p < 0.001), and the correlation coefficients did not differ by sex (p = 0.76). Mediterranean diet score and age both reduced the odds of elevated anxiety (GAD-7 ≥ 10), while female sex, deterioration of diet quality during the outbreak, unemployment, and completing the survey in English increased the odds of this outcome. During the COVID-19 lockdowns, overall diet quality did not differ by sex; however, some differences by sex in components of the total score were detected. Moderate to severe anxiety was positively associated with female sex and poorer diet quality even after controlling for age, employment status, and the language in which the survey was performed.",2021,"Nutrients","13","12","",34959744,"10.3390/nu13124193","Asia"

Drawing on interviews with port-based support organizations and various other international organizations, we outline how pre-existing structural marginalizations of seafarers in distant water fishing has made them particularly vulnerable to the negative impacts of pandemic management policies for seafarers. We focus our analysis on obstacles to crew change and reduced access to crucial shore services. The basis of these longer term marginalizations includes the exclusion of fishing from the Maritime Labor Convention, the marginal status of fishing among global organizations concerned with seafarers, the dispersed ownership of fishing vessels compared to concentrated corporate ownership in shipping, lack of unionization, and frequent inaccessibility of consular assistance in fishing ports. We also highlight differences among important fishing ports, showing that repatriation of crew and access to shore services is the outcome of negotiation among a constellation of port-based actors.",2021,"Mar Policy","134","","104796",34539041,"10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104796","Asia"

R.; Razzaq, A.; Yu, Z.; Shah, A.; Sharif, A.; Janjua, L.","Undernourishment and associated health issues are some mammoth challenges that the world currently faces. The poorly design food supply chain (FSC) is considered a root cause of high undernourishment cases worldwide. Since all processes and stages in a supply chain are strongly connected, a slight delay or glitch can trigger a butterfly effect resulting in significant socio-economic losses. The FSC is vital to providing human essentials and a source of bread earning; rank at the top in global industries and any disturbance results in high unemployment and leading social evils like crime and violence in society. Recognize the same; this study examines the impact of food supply chain disruption on undernourished cases in selected Asian countries. Using Generalized Methods of Moments (GMM) estimator, this study provides two key findings. First, a higher intensity of COVID-19 cases translates into higher undernourishment due to direct and indirect effects from higher stringency measures. Secondly, government financial allocations to combat COVID-19 and economic growth significantly mitigate the prevalence of undernourishment. Interestingly, a higher crime index is linked with higher undernourished cases supporting the proposition of socio-economic disorder. These results propose broad policy implications for governments, food regulatory authority, donor agencies, and Non-Governmental Organizations by strengthening the food supply chain and thus reduces undernourishment cases. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,"Socio-Economic Planning Sciences","","","",NA,"10.1016/j.seps.2021.101033","Asia"

In 2020, the travel and gathering bans due to the global COVID-19 pandemic meant that these meetings were held “virtually,” primarily via videoconferencing. But can virtual meetings perform the same functions and deliver the same management outcomes as face-to-face meetings? This study is an initial investigation of the experiences, perceptions and attitudes of WCPO region government participants in a number of virtual regional fisheries meetings in 2020. Results indicate a strong preference for face-to-face regional meetings, with the perception that virtual meetings performed comparatively poorly at supporting a number of key meeting processes and outcomes. However, one-quarter to one-third of study participants consistently found no difference between format performance for many meeting processes and outcomes. Virtual formats were considered more appropriate for smaller and non-regional meetings, and allowed for greater staff attendance at meetings as well as cost and time savings for some, but not all, participants. Study participants believe that virtual regional meetings will be more common in the region in the future, despite nearly half indicating that virtual meeting are not a good fit for the region generally. Many of these experiences and perceptions are consistent with organizational behavior, communications media, and information systems literature. Some results appear unique to the region’s socially and culturally diverse Pacific island countries and territories, which are relative newcomers to the global information and communication technology “revolution.” A greater use of virtual regional fisheries meetings in the future requires meeting hosts and facilitators to carefully consider the potential impacts of virtual meetings on effective communication and inclusive participation in WCPO regional fisheries management and other governance outcomes. © Copyright © 2021 Campbell, McIlgorm and Voyer.",2021,"Frontiers in Marine Science","8","","",NA,"10.3389/fmars.2021.710088","Asia"
