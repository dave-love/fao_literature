"2","A “new normality” for small-scale artisanal Fishers? The case of unregulated fisheries during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Bahía Blanca estuary (SW Atlantic Ocean)","Truchet, D. M.; Buzzi, N. S.; Noceti, M. B.","The current COVID-19 pandemic is causing health and economic crises worldwide, but consequences are worse for those emerging countries with poor sanitary conditions struggling against economic recessions. Small-scale artisanal fishers (SSAF) should be considered among the “essential workers” since they provide food services; however, the COVID-19 might have altered the normal livelihood and reduced people economic incomes in an already marginalized sector. This situation highlights the fishers' vulnerability, derived from changes in fish stocks caused by climate change, pollution, overharvesting, and informal work (illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing). Therefore, the so-called “new normality” raises big questions about the management of coastal areas and fisheries in developing countries. As a study case, we proposed exploring SSAF from an Argentinian estuary, the Bahía Blanca estuary (SW Atlantic Ocean). Most of them are unregulated after a reconversion program carried out by the local government in 2012. After reviewing the current COVID-19 legislation for coastal fisheries and having virtual encounters with SSAF, we observed they are struggling against the economic crisis caused by the pandemic. According to our observations, imperative measures must be taken to prevent fisheries collapse in the area. In this work, we present a reference point for the post-pandemic management of fisheries that could be considered for emerging public policies. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,"Ocean and Coastal Management","206","","",NA,"10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.105585","Latin America and Caribbean"
"3","Food security and COVID-19 in Latin America: A challenge to overcome","Cuenca, M. H.","Latin America is a region full of challenges due to its characteristics. The COVID-19 pandemic arrived in an unprepared region that must take action for controlling an emergency of a large magnitude, which is not surprising because of the economic decline, the increase in hunger, and informal employment experienced in recent decades. Previous efforts to eradicate hunger and move closer to meeting the number two goal of sustainable development are facing now a setback given the slowdown in activities because of the pandemic. The projection of the increase in intraregional poverty reported by CEPAL is a call for attention to the reformulation of policies associated with the dimensions of poverty and in particular the food and nutritional security of the population. Policies should focus on two levels: an immediate level of attention to the vulnerable population and another dedicated to planning structural actions with a view to the middle and long term. © 2020 Academia Nacional de Medicina.

G.; Olivares, G. F.; Zavala, R.; Grilo, M. F.; Parra, D. C.; Duran, A. C.","BACKGROUND: School feeding programs (SFPs) can play a crucial role in the emergency food and nutrition response, but there is a dearth of information on how SFPs operate during emergencies. DESIGN AND METHODS: A rapid comparative assessment of 11 SFPs throughout Latin America and the Caribbean during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from (1) systematic document search and (2) surveys with key informants (n = 23) about barriers/facilitators to modifications were systematically analyzed using a multiple case study approach. RESULTS: During the pandemic, all SFPs continued (although continuation plans varied from a few days in Chile to >1 month in Puerto Rico) via food kits, food vouchers, and/or grab n' go meals. The SFP implementation was highly dependent on the programs' autonomy and financial support, which impacted their logistics to acquire and distribute foods during the pandemic. The types of foods offered in some SFPs suggest that established nutritional guidelines were not always followed. Key informants expressed concerns about the deterioration of the nutritional quality of foods offered during the pandemic and lack of community engagement that impeded distribution to the neediest. CONCLUSIONS: Results underscore the urgency for clear implementation guidance on how to modify SFP during emergencies. Public health implications include (1) allocation of autonomous resources to an intersectoral working group to safeguard nutritional benefits during emergencies, (2) strengthening efforts of SFP community engagement before and during emergencies, and (3) establishing guidelines of the types of foods that can be distributed to meet the nutritional needs of beneficiaries during emergencies.",2021,"Food Nutr Bull","","","3795721211062371",34894790,"10.1177/03795721211062371","Latin America and Caribbean"

"6","Slower Ship Speed in the Bahamas Due to COVID-19 Produces a Dramatic Reduction in Ocean Sound Levels","Dunn, C.; Theriault, J.; Hickmott, L.; Claridge, D.","As underwater noise from ship traffic increases, profound effects on the marine environment highlight the need for improved mitigation measures. One measure, reduction in ship speed, has been shown to be one of the key drivers in reducing sound source levels of vessels. In 2017, a study began to assess the impacts of increasing commercial shipping traffic on sperm whales in Northwest Providence Channel, northern Bahamas, an international trade route that primarily serves the southeast US. Ship data were collected from an Automatic Identification System (AIS) station combined with recordings from an acoustic recorder to measure underwater sound levels and to detect the presence of sperm whales. Here we analyze a subset of these data to opportunistically investigate potential changes in ship traffic before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. These data span one calendar year from October 2019 to October 2020. A pre-COVID-19 dataset of 121 days, from a recorder approximately 2 km from the shipping route was compared to a 134-day dataset collected during COVID-19 from the same site, comprising 2900 and 3181 ten-minute recordings, respectively. A dramatic decrease in ocean noise levels concurrent with changes in shipping activity occurred during the pandemic. The mean pre-COVID-19 power density level in the 111–140 Hz 1/3-octave band was 88.81 dB re 1 μPa (range 81.38–100.90) and decreased to 84.27 dB re 1 μPa (range 78.60–99.51) during COVID-19, equating to a 41% reduction in sound pressure levels (SPL). After differences in seasonal changes in wind speed were accounted for, SPL decreased during the pandemic by 3.98 dB (37%). The most notable changes in ship activity were significantly reduced vessel speeds for all ship types and fewer ships using the area during the pandemic. Vessel speed was highly correlated to SPL and the only ship-based variable that predicted SPLs. Despite the opportunistic nature [i.e., not a standard before-after-control-impact (BACI) study], this study provides a unique opportunity to assess the effectiveness of ship traffic management strategies, such as slowing ships down, to mitigate impacts on marine life in the study area, including local sperm whale populations. © Copyright © 2021 Dunn, Theriault, Hickmott and Claridge.",2021,"Frontiers in Marine Science","8","","",NA,"10.3389/fmars.2021.673565","Latin America and Caribbean"
"7","Blue economy and blue activities: Opportunities, challenges, and recommendations for the bahamas","Bethel, B. J.; Buravleva, Y.; Tang, D.","Following the global shutdown of tourism at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, small island developing states such as The Bahamas had their economies immobilized due to their heavy dependence on the industry. Beyond economic recovery in a post COVID-19 paradigm, the blue economy, blue growth, and associated activities offer pathways for a more resilient economy and is well-suited for The Bahamas. This paper suggests conduits for economic development using a traditional strength, coastal and marine tourism, in conjunction with the emerging fields of ocean renewable energy, offshore aquaculture, marine biotechnology, and bioprospecting. The interlinkages between each activity are discussed. Knowledge gaps in offshore aquaculture, ocean renewable energy, marine biotechnology, and marine environment monitoring are identified. In each sector case, strategic and tactical decision-making can be achieved through the exploitation of ocean numerical modeling and observations, and consequently should be invested in and developed alongside the requisite computational resources. Blue growth is encouraged, but instances of blue injustice are also highlighted. Crucially, pursuing blue economy activities should be given top national priority for economic recovery and prosperity. © 2021 by the authors.

"8","Impact of the the COVID-19 pandemic on a queen conch (Aliger gigas) fishery in The Bahamas","Higgs, N. D.","The onset of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in early 2020 led to a dramatic rise in unemployment and fears about food-security throughout the Caribbean region. Subsistence fisheries were one of the few activities permitted during emergency lockdown in The Bahamas, leading many to turn to the sea for food. Detailed monitoring of a small-scale subsistence fishery for queen conch was undertaken during the implementation of coronavirus emergency control measures over a period of twelve weeks. Weekly landings data showed a surge in fishing during the first three weeks where landings were 3.4 times higher than subsequent weeks. Overall 90% of the catch was below the minimum legal-size threshold and individual yield declined by 22% during the lockdown period. This study highlights the role of small-scale fisheries as a 'natural insurance' against socio-economic shocks and a source of resilience for small island communities at times of crisis. It also underscores the risks to food security and long-term sustainability of fishery stocks posed by overexploitation of natural resources.",2021,"PeerJ","9","","e11924",34414036,"10.7717/peerj.11924","Latin America and Caribbean"
"9","Estimating marine plastic pollution from COVID-19 face masks in coastal regions","Chowdhury, H.; Chowdhury, T.; Sait, S. M.","Face masks are playing an essential role in preventing the spread of COVID-19. Face masks such as N95, and surgical masks, contain a considerable portion of non-recyclable plastic material. Marine plastic pollution is likely to increase due to the rapid use and improper dispensing of face masks, but until now, no extensive quantitative estimation exists for coastal regions. Linking behaviour dataset on face mask usage and solid waste management dataset, this study estimates annual face mask utilization and plastic pollution from mismanaged face masks in coastal regions of 46 countries. It is estimated that approximately 0.15 million tons to 0.39 million tons of plastic debris could end up in global oceans within a year. With lower waste management facilities, the number of plastic debris entering the ocean will rise. Significant investments are required from global communities in improving the waste management facilities for better disposal of masks and solid waste.",2021,"Mar Pollut Bull","168","","112419",33930644,"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.112419","Latin America and Caribbean"

L.; Evans, C.; Carrias, A.; Rosado, A.; Griffin, R.; Cherrington, E. A.; Ayad, M.; Rudresh, M.; Page, B. P.; Jay, J. A.","The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic halted human activities globally in multiple sectors including tourism. As a result, nations with heavy tourism, such as Belize, experienced improvements in water quality. Remote sensing technologies can detect impacts of “anthropauses” on coastal water quality. In this study, moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data were employed along the Belizean coast to investigate impacts of the COVID-19 shutdown on water quality. The attenuation coefficient at 490 nm, Kd(490), was used as an indicator of water quality, with a lower Kd(490) indicating increased water clarity. Four Coastal Management Zones were characterized by marine traffic as high traffic areas (HTAs) and two as low traffic areas (LTAs). Monthly composites for two periods, 2002–2019 (baseline) and 2020 were examined for Kd(490). For months prior to the COVID-19 shutdown in Belize, there was generally no significant difference in Kd(490) (p &gt; 0.05) between 2020 and baseline period in HTAs and LTAs. Through the shutdown, Kd was lower in 2020 at HTAs, but not for LTAs. At the LTAs, the Kd(490)s observed in 2020 were similar to previous years through October. In November, an unusually active hurricane season in 2020 was associated with decreased water clarity along the entire coast of Belize. This study provides proof of concept that satellite-based monitoring of water quality can complement in situ data and provide evidence of significant water quality improvements due to the COVID-19 shutdown, likely due to reduced marine traffic. However, these improvements were no longer observed following an active hurricane season. © Copyright © 2021 Callejas, Lee, Mishra, Felgate, Evans, Carrias, Rosado, Griffin, Cherrington, Ayad, Rudresh, Page and Jay.",2021,"Frontiers in Marine Science","8","","",NA,"10.3389/fmars.2021.648522","Latin America and Caribbean"

T.; de Assis Guedes de Vasconcelos, F.","This scientific note presents preliminary developments of the Covid-19 pandemic on unemployment, poverty, and hunger in Brazil. The data on unemployment rate, un employment insurance claims, contingent of families in extreme poverty, and food insecurity was collected in government information systems, research published by public agencies, scientific articles, and in news portals. In an upward trajectory since 2015, the increase in unemployment and the number of families in extreme poverty was exacerbated after the pandemic began, drastically reducing the purchase power and access to healthy and adequate food, affecting mainly women and the populations of the Northern and Northeastern regions. Between January and September 2020, there was a 3% increase in unemployment in Brazil and, in October 2020, there were almost 485 thousand more families in extreme poverty compared to January of the same year. There are inadequate and insufficient responses from the Brazilian government to the articulated set of problems. The Covid-19 pandemic is a new element that potentiates the recent increase in hunger in Brazil, which occurs in parallel with the dismantling of the Food and Nutrition Security programs and the expansion of fiscal austerity measures, started with the political-economic crisis in 2015. There is an urgent need to recover the centrality of the agenda to fight hunger in Brazil, associated with the development of more robust contributions on the impact of the pandemic on the phenomena of poverty and hunger. © 2021.

Utilizaram-se dados sobre a taxa de desocupação, solicitações de seguro-desemprego e contingente de famílias em extrema pobreza e em insegurança alimentar, coletados em sistemas de informação governamentais, em pesquisas publicadas por órgãos públicos, em artigos científicos e em portais de notícias. Em trajetória ascendente, desde 2015, identificou-se um aumento do desemprego e do número de famílias em extrema pobreza após a instauração da pandemia, o que pode reduzir drasticamente o poder de compra e o acesso à alimentação adequada e saudável, afetando, principalmente, as mulheres e a população das regiões Norte e Nordeste. Entre janeiro e setembro de 2020, houve o aumento de 3% desemprego no Brasil e, em outubro de 2020, havia quase 485 mil famílias a mais em situação de extrema pobreza, relativamente a janeiro do mesmo ano. Verificam-se respostas inadequadas e insuficientes do governo brasileiro frente ao conjunto articulado de problemas.

The literature has reported that the pandemic affects the hegemonic food system in various ways. In Brazil, the pandemic amplifies existing social, racial, and gender inequalities, further jeopardizing the Human Right to Adequate Food (HRAF) and the attainment of food and nutritional security, especially among more vulnerable groups. In this context, the article aims to analyze the first measures by the Brazilian Federal Government to mitigate the pandemic's effects and that may have repercussions on food and nutritional security, considering the recent institutional changes in policies and programs. A narrative literature review was performed, and the information sources were the bulletins of the Center for Coordination of Operations by the Crisis Committee for Supervising and Monitoring the Impacts of COVID-19 and homepages of various government ministries, from March to May 2020. The actions were systematized according to the guidelines of the National Policy for Food and Nutritional Security. The analysis identified the creation of institutional crisis management arrangements. The proposed actions feature those involving access to income, emergency aid, and food, such as authorization for food distribution outside schools with federal funds from the National School Feeding Program.

In this paper, we argue that the risks to hunger and food security in Brazil have been present since 2016 and are now being exacerbated due to the emergence of the COVID-19 epidemic. This situation requires knowing the extent and magnitude of the issue and articulation of measures in the three governmental spheres(federal, municipal and state) to ensure access to adequate and healthy food and reduce the disease's adverse effectson the diet, health, and nutrition among the most vulnerable people.

S.; Pereira, E. A. S.; Maia, M. E. S.; Silva, M. G. F.","The use of unproven COVID‐19 drugs has seen a massive increase in recent months in Brazil. Chloroquine (CQ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and ivermectin (IVM) are among the most politically promoted and sold drugs. As a result, an increased demand for these pharmaceuticals has been observed across the country with sales increase by more than 50% in comparison to 2019. In a country where only 46% of domestic wastewater is treated, what can we expect from the effects of these drugs and their metabolites on aquatic wildlife? The environmental fate and ecotoxicity data for IVM indicate varying degrees of toxicity to aquatic invertebrates and the potential to accumulate in several aquatic organisms. The CQ compound was classified as harmful to aquatic organisms and may cause long‐term adverse effects in the aquatic environment. As for HCQ, it has been tagged as posing insignificant environmental risks in the pre‐pandemic scenario despite its environmental persistence. Fragile Brazilian biomes, such as the Amazon (North region), Caatinga and coastal region of the Northeast and the Atlantic Rainforest (Southeast region) are of particular concern given the high incidence of COVID‐19 cases in these areas. The large‐scale use of unproven drugs in response to the pandemic may add undue weight to the increased volume of pharmaceuticals entering the environment, leaving the local biota vulnerable to the harmful effects of these contaminants. A nationwide coordinated response is urgently needed to monitor the levels and investigate the impacts of these emerging contaminants. This article is protected by copyright.

The mobility restriction measures adopted internationally to contain Covid-19 are necessary to control the pandemic progress. However, they can impair food production and distribution. This paper aims to discuss the effects of the Covid-19 containment measures on the production and distribution of family farming food, and strategies to strengthen this sector. Sanitary and social distancing requirements, the interruption of supply to institutional markets, the closure of local farmers’ markets, or people’s declining food demand are hampering family farming food production’s flow and shrinking family farmers’ income. This situation can jeopardize the food sovereignty and nutritional security of the population in the medium and long term. Access to Personal Protective Equipment, the reorganization of local farmers’ markets, investment in new technologies for direct commercialization, guarantee of minimum income, and the strengthening/expansion of institutional food purchases are some of the strategies that can contribute to overcome the new challenges imposed on family farming as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. We conclude the article by arguing that the support to and enhancement of the family farming sector are strategic to ensure food supply and to strengthen food and nutrition sovereignty and security. © 2020.

C.; Amaral, C.; Lopes, P. F. M.","Small-scale fishers in the developing world have been particularly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic given that they belong to one of the most socioeconomically vulnerable groups. In Brazil, one of the countries most affected by the pandemic, it was expected early on that the economy and wellbeing of fishers would be negatively impacted, yet fishers were expected to show some adaptive and coping mechanisms. To assess whether this was the case, 40 fishers, who are also leaders of fishing associations representing over 80 thousand fishers throughout the country, were interviewed. Results revealed that female leaders appraised the economic and health / wellbeing impacts to be harsher on fishers than men did. Moreover, fishers on the coast were found to be better able to adapt than those inland, although both had low levels of adaptive capacity. The nature of coping and adaptive mechanisms was also found to be different between locations. Whereas leaders from coastal associations stated that most of the adaptive responses occurred in the post-harvest sector (e.g., changes to the types of sales and changes to supply chain actors), leaders from inland communities stated that the changes that occurred related specifically to fishing (e.g., decrease in effort and changes in fishing grounds). These findings suggest that: 1) women may be better prepared to respond to COVID-19 because their appraisal may be more realistic than men, 2) the historic vulnerability of fishing communities may limit their adaptative capacity, and 3) coastal fishers have likely found ways to maintain part of their trade, contrary to inland fishers. Thus, to better help small-scale fisheries to cope with this particular pandemic or other large disruptive impacts, it would be recommended to invest in women in leadership roles while also guaranteeing that fishers have the minimal conditions to cope with and adapt to impacts. The latter can be done by assuring emergency cash transfers for the duration of the impact, as with the still ongoing pandemic, and investing in building fisher resilience for future shocks.",2022,"Mar Policy","135","","104842",34732972,"10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104842","Latin America and Caribbean"

Citizens were forced to stay in quarantine, affecting their food consumption habits and food sector. These impacts have not yet been properly understood. Thus, it is important to describe the consequences of COVID-19 on food consumption habits globally, especially in the context of developing countries, such as Brazil. SCOPE AND APPROACH: In this study, the Brazilian's food consumption habits and perceptions during the COVID-19 pandemic were assessed, highlighting the food consumption changes and selection of food products. Consumer perceptions about issues related to food safety and food marketing were also assessed. An online survey was performed and data were analyzed by descriptive analysis; independence and per cell chi-square test; and factor analysis. KEY FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS: Brazilians perceptions indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic context (assessed in May 2020) changed their food consumption and purchase. Respondents stated that they are eating and buying a greater amount of food, indicating a perception of a less healthy diet, mainly by women. On other hand, they are prioritizing homemade preparations and fresh food. Moreover, they reduced their shopping trips to markets and are starting to use delivery services and shopping platforms. Basic products of animal, vegetable, and bakery origin are being preferred during this period, in addition to economical packaging and products. Brazilians also indicated that they are more concerned with food safety and hygienic practices. However, at a time when global health is threatened, government agencies must create measures that ensure the food supply and consumer's awareness, in order to guarantee the country's food security during the current crisis.",2021,"Trends Food Sci Technol","116","","992-1001",34539079,"10.1016/j.tifs.2021.09.005","Latin America and Caribbean"

L.; Machado-Coelho, G. L. L.; Menezes, M. C.","BACKGROUND & AIM: Psychological disorders are an important health problem worldwide. A healthy diet is recommended as one of the measures to prevent and control mental disorders. Epidemiological studies have shown important associations between the consumption of diets rich in nutrients and a lower risk of developing anxiety and depression. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the association between the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms and food consumption, according to the degree of processing, during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An epidemiological household survey was conducted in two cities in Brazil. Anxiety and depression symptoms were assessed using validated scales (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item/Patient Health Questionnaire-9), and food consumption was assessed using a qualitative food frequency questionnaire referring to consumption within the last 3 months. The foods were categorized according to the NOVA classification for fresh/minimally processed food and ultra-processed food, using the average weekly consumption as the cutoff. For data analysis, adjusted Poisson regression with robust variance was utilized to estimate the prevalence ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: The consumption of fresh/minimally processed foods above the weekly average frequency was associated with a lower prevalence of symptoms of depression (PR: 0.5, 95% CI: 0.3; 0.7). Consumption above the weekly average of ultra-processed foods was associated with a higher prevalence of anxiety (PR: 1.5 and 95% CI: 1.03; 2.3) and depression symptoms (PR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.0; 2.1, P = 0.034). CONCLUSION: Increased consumption of ultra-processed foods is associated with a higher occurrence of anxiety and depression symptoms; therefore, we recommend an increase in the consumption of fresh/minimally processed foods, as endorsed by the Dietary Guidelines for the Brazilian Population.",2022,"Clin Nutr ESPEN","47","","206-214",35063203,"10.1016/j.clnesp.2021.12.013","Latin America and Caribbean"

B.","This study aimed to evaluate changes in dietary and lifestyle habits during the period of confinement due to the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ibero-American countries. A cross-sectional investigation was conducted with 6,325 participants of both genders (68% women), over 18 years of age and from five countries: Brazil (N = 2,171), Argentina (N = 1,111), Peru (N = 1,174), Mexico (N = 686), and Spain (N = 1,183). Data were collected during the year 2020, between April 01 and June 30 in Spain and between July 13 and September 26, in the other countries studied using a self-administered online survey designed for the assessment of sociodemographic, employment, physical activity, health status, and dietary habits changes. Most participants (61.6%), mainly those from Spain, remained constant, without improving or worsening their pattern of food consumption. Among those who changed, a pattern of better eating choices prevailed (22.7%) in comparison with those who changed toward less healthy choices (15.7%). Argentina and Brazil showed the highest proportion of changes toward a healthier pattern of food consumption. Peruvians and Mexicans were less likely to make healthy changes in food consumption (OR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.4-0.6 and OR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.4-0.8, respectively), when compared to Argentinians. Most respondents did not change their pattern of meal consumption, but those who did reduced their consumption of main meals and increased intake of small meals and snacks. Although most participants affirmed to be doing physical activity at home, about one-half reported perception of weight gain. Individuals with alterations in sleep pattern (either by increasing or decreasing sleep time) were more likely to change their diets to a healthier pattern. In contrast, individuals with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and those who reported feeling anxious were more likely to perform changes to a less healthy eating pattern (OR: 1.72; 95% CI: 1.2-2.3 and OR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.1-1.4, respectively). In conclusion, although most participants remained constant in their eating habits, lifestyle changes and anxiety feelings were reported. Among those who changed patterns of food consumption, healthier choices prevailed, with differences between countries. However, there were alterations in the distribution of meals, with higher consumption of snacks and small meals. These results can be used to guide policies to prevent deleterious consequences that may affect the incidence of chronic diseases.",2021,"Front Nutr","8","","671004",34150828,"10.3389/fnut.2021.671004","Latin America and Caribbean"

S.; Zarauz, L.","This work is the result of an international research effort to determine the main impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on marine recreational fishing. Changes were assessed on (1) access to fishing, derived from lockdowns and other mobility restrictions; (2) ecosystems, because of alterations in fishing intensity and human presence; (3) the blue economy, derived from alterations in the investments and expenses of the fishers; and (4) society, in relation to variations in fishers’ health and well-being. For this, a consultation with experts from 16 countries was carried out, as well as an international online survey aimed at recreational fishers, that included specific questions designed to capture fishers’ heterogeneity in relation to behavior, skills and know-how, and vital involvement. Fishers’ participation in the online survey (5,998 recreational fishers in 15 countries) was promoted through a marketing campaign. The sensitivity of the fishers’ clustering procedure, based on the captured heterogeneity, was evaluated by SIMPER analysis and by generalized linear models. Results from the expert consultation highlighted a worldwide reduction in marine recreational fishing activity. Lower human-driven pressures are expected to generate some benefits for marine ecosystems. However, experts also identified high negative impacts on the blue economy, as well as on fisher health and well-being because of the loss of recreational fishing opportunities. Most (98%) of the fishers who participated in the online survey were identified as advanced, showing a much higher degree of commitment to recreational fishing than basic fishers (2%). Advanced fishers were, in general, more pessimistic about the impacts of COVID-19, reporting higher reductions in physical activity and fish consumption, as well as poorer quality of night rest, foul mood, and raised more concerns about their health status. Controlled and safe access to marine recreational fisheries during pandemics would provide benefits to the health and well-being of people and reduce negative socioeconomic impacts, especially for vulnerable social groups.

T.; Aktas, E.","Brazil and the UK have been strategic partners throughout the years. While the former has traded minerals and food products – mainly agricultural commodities – the latter has been critical to infrastructure development in the South American country. However, the Crisis of COVID-19 Pandemic altered the scenario of international food production and distribution. This article aims to analyse Brazilian food exports to the UK in 2019 and 2020 to identify the impact of COVID-19 on the trade flows. To do so, we collected data from the Brazilian Ministry of Economy regarding the exports between the two nations and performed an exploratory investigation using graphical and quantitative analysis. The results suggest that the Pandemic crisis rose Brazilian exports of cereal and grains to the UK by around 50%, and the shortage of these items in the internal market has increased consumer prices by more than 60% during 2020. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.",2021,"","631 IFIP","","577-584",NA,"10.1007/978-3-030-85902-2_61","Latin America and Caribbean"

The role of different management approaches in reducing risk and vulnerability is also explored. Results suggest that concession areas having the largest accumulated and current biomass have the highest risk, which is also transferred to the municipal level. The scenarios modelled with better management practices that reduce diseases were able to reduce risks by 30-40%. The largest risk reduction is achieved when production biomass is divided in a more equitable manner among concession areas, suggesting the need for strategic improvements in spatial planning of the activity in the marine environment according to ecosystem carrying capacity and better practices. Improving adaptation capacity can reduce vulnerability between 20% and 30% for municipalities; for example, providing local employment can be a win-win management measure under the COVID-19 threat because it reduces movement of people and facilitates handling and responses to emergencies. A larger footprint in local economies and employment can also improve social perception and acceptance of the sector, thus contributing to improve adaptation changes and governance to face the threats. The framework used here to perform a risk and vulnerability assessment of salmon farming to the pandemic-associated threats can also be useful for other aquaculture systems elsewhere, provided that relevant information is available.",2021,"Mar Policy","128","","104486",35125618,"10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104486","Latin America and Caribbean"

H.","The COVID-19 pandemic has inspired novel strategies for keeping worksites operational and workers safe, with varying degrees of success. In southern Chile, where more than a third of the world’s farmed salmon is produced, the industrial aquaculture sector has been largely successful at avoiding major disruptions and financial losses by mobilizing strategies developed during previous sanitary crises that threatened the health of fish and the industry itself. Here, I engage with the literature on crises and disasters to evaluate these strategies as well as their unintended consequences. I contend that many of the strategies developed to address COVID-19 as a sanitary crisis and prevent the spread of the virus have deepened the divisions between aquaculture firms and the remote coastal communities where they operate. These social and economic divisions have the potential to undermine the industry’s long-term viability. © 2021 American Anthropological Association.",2021,"Culture, Agriculture, Food and Environment","43","1","14-24",NA,"10.1111/cuag.12265","Latin America and Caribbean"

Maritime navigation has been affected in strategic connections between some regions in Patagonia, at the southern end of South America. The purpose of this research is to describe this interruption of navigation using satellite synthetic aperture radar data. For this goal, three locations are observed using geoinformatic techniques and high-resolution satellite data from the Sentinel-1 satellites of the European Commission’s Copernicus programme. The spatial information is analyzed using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform as a global geographical information system and the EO Browser tool, integrated with several satellite data. The results demonstrate that the total maritime traffic activity in the three geographical hotspots selected along western Patagonia, the Chacao Channel, crossing of the Reloncavi Fjord and the Strait of Magellan was totally interrupted during April–May 2020. This fact has relevant repercussions for the population living in isolated areas, such as many places in Patagonia, including Tierra del Fuego.

Like other First Nation communities, these nomadic people suffered decimation and disease in successive encounters with Europeans, and then, in the mid-twentieth century, forced sedentarization by the Chilean State. More recently, the Yagan have fought the expansion of salmon aquaculture to the Island. Making use of a sociomaterial approach, we examine how the threat of past and present viruses and diseases, added to the tragic effects of colonization, become part of a broader sociohistorical debate on the right of coastal peoples to their maritories. Paradoxically, our results suggest that COVID-19 has become part of an assemblage of ethnic revitalization, opening possibilities for the Yagan clans to make some of their envisioned futures possible. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.",2021,"Maritime Studies","20","1","101-113",NA,"10.1007/s40152-021-00217-2","Latin America and Caribbean"

C.; Harte, A.; Piccolo, M. C.; Marcovecchio, J. E.","Plastic use and production have dramatically increased globally over the past 65 years with the improvement of life quality by the daily use of plastic products. Still, around 50% of the plastic produced is disposable products that generate substantial waste. Several reports pointed out the adverse effects of plastic litter in coastal environments in recent years, emphasizing single-use plastics (SUP). In this manner, Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) coastal environments are highly vulnerable due to wastewater treatment facilities scarcity and poor plastic waste management strategies. Since COVID-19 pandemic, the single-use plastic waste/person rate is expected to rise due to the use of personal protective equipment and SUP as health care measures. Based on literature research and the review of plastic waste regulations, this paper will assess the main COVID-19 plastic pollution threats and LAC beaches' regulations to suggest possible measures to abate this problem. The main findings suggest that unifying the ongoing fragmented and overlapped policies is key to abate plastic pollution, including plastic industry regulations and circular economies. In addition, increasing public risk perception about plastic pollution is critical to reducing plastic waste generation. Research advances in the adverse effects of plastic debris could improve the public's perception of plastic pollution risk, pushing forward global marine plastic governance. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,"Ocean and Coastal Management","208","","",NA,"10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.105613","Latin America and Caribbean"
"33","The Case for Healthy U.S.‐China Agricultural Trade Relations despite Deglobalization Pressures","Zhang, Wendong","The COVID‐19 pandemic is crippling the global economy and heightening distrust and political disagreements among major countries. Furthermore, ongoing deglobalization efforts taken by firms and countries are fueling the rise of economic nationalism. A prime example is the possible decoupling of US–China economic and trade relations, which the ongoing trade war has already significantly disrupted. This paper analyzes the impacts of COVID‐19 on US agricultural exports to China, especially the added delays and uncertainty regarding China's food imports meeting the US–China phase one trade deal target. I present the views of US farmers and the general public toward China and argue that healthy US–China agricultural trade relations are not only critical for both countries but welcomed by US farmers. I also discuss the possible rise in nontariff barriers following the pandemic as well as trade policies that are increasingly intertwined with political tensions. Finally, I discuss how the US–China phase one trade deal could possibly lead to a more balanced bilateral agricultural trade portfolio with greater share of protein and retail food products.

D.; García-Villanova, B.","The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of coronavirus SARS-Cov2 (COVID-19) confinement measures in Colombia on the dietary behaviors of a large population sample, at national and regional levels. A survey was conducted to assess dietary behaviors during the COVID-19 confinement. The survey involved 2,745 participants, aged 18 years or older, from six regions of the country (Atlántica, Bogotá, Central, Oriental, Orinoquía and Amazonía, and Pacífica). Dietary intake of foods and foods groups in grams per day before and during the confinement was estimated by considering standard serving sizes of foods. One-way ANOVA was used to analyze differences between the regions with regard to dietary behavior changes during the confinement. Differences were deemed significant at p-value < 0.05. Dietary patterns (DPs) before and during the confinement were derived from principal component analysis. Certain dietary habits were adopted by the study population during the confinement (e.g., higher frequency of snacking and home cooking), with significant differences by regions with regard to these habits, as well as regarding culinary processes. The levels of consumption of several foods also changed during the confinement, nationally and regionally. We identified three DPs before the confinement (protein-rich, carbohydrate-rich, and sugar foods patterns) and four DPs during the confinement (westernized, carbohydrate-rich, protein-rich, fish and fruits-vegetable patterns), with an explained total variance of 33 and 45%, respectively. The profile of these DPs varied to some extent between the regions; their adherence to each DP also varied (p-value < 0.001). Our results show that there were marked differences by regions in the dietary behaviors of this population during the confinement, with an overall trend toward unhealthier DPs. These results may help to shape public health nutrition interventions in Colombia during the COVID-19 pandemic and in a post-COVID stage.",2021,"Front Nutr","8","","644800",33912582,"10.3389/fnut.2021.644800","Latin America and Caribbean"
"35","COVID-19 Impacts on Beaches and Coastal Water Pollution at Selected Sites in Ecuador, and Management Proposals Post-pandemic","Ormaza-Gonzaìlez, F. I.; Castro-Rodas, D.; Statham, P. J.","The COVID-19 pandemic has obliged Governments all around the world to implement confinement and social distancing measures. Leisure and business activities on beaches and in ports have restricted direct and indirect contamination from, for example, plastics, hydrocarbon spillage, microbiological loads, and noise levels. This has led to temporarily improved environmental conditions, and the beaches having conditions closer to Marine Protected Areas. Here we report some impacts that have been studied using local surveys and qualitative observations in Ecuador at the popular beaches and ports of Salinas, Manta, and Galapagos. Satellite data support this information. Online surveys were carried out at critical moments of the pandemic: May (15th) and just after when measures were relaxed a little, but within lockdown in July (21st) 2020. Respondents were asked to compare conditions before and during the pandemic lockdown. Most (97–99%) suggested that beaches had significantly improved from visual observations during confinement. On a scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best), the beaches of Salinas and Manta respectively were rated 2.2 and 2.8 (less than acceptable) before quarantine, and 4.5 and 4.3 after; results from the second survey (after 18 weeks of restrictions) were much the same. Replies from Galapagos showed a similar trend but with less marked differences. In addition to the beaches having less plastic and garbage, more fish, and large marine organisms, including humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), dolphin (bottlenose, Tursiops truncatus), and manta ray (Manta sp.) were observed near to shore. At Galapagos beaches, turtles, sea lions, and sharks were observed many more times than pre COVID. Quantitative satellite data on Chlorophyl and attenuation coefficient (Kd, 490 nm) support the qualitative survey data that there is an improvement in coastal environment quality. Here we recommend that this unique opportunity resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic is used locally, regionally and globally to construct baseline data sets that include information on physical, chemical, biological, and microbiological factors in coastal zones. These parameters can then help establish an effective Coastal Zone Management Plan based on beach description and quality (water standards, noise pollution), as well as the human dimension (tourist load, cultural heritage, and economic value indices). This data and information gathering ideally should be done before the beaches become more heavily used again as the pandemic recedes. © Copyright © 2021 Ormaza-González, Castro-Rodas and Statham.",2021,"Frontiers in Marine Science","8","","",NA,"10.3389/fmars.2021.669374","Latin America and Caribbean"

R.; Vina, M.","Within the many fishing communities that dot the southern coast of Manabí province, Ecuador, everyday realities are more diverse and uneven than those suggested by the romantic images circulating in the global media. This article zooms in on a maritime-fishing territory located in the Puerto Lopez canton to illustrate the challenges posed by globalization processes at different scales. Drawing on Ribeiro’s concept of globalizations from below, this work analyses the ambiguous relations between artisanal and industrial fishing sectors, marine conservation and fishers’ livelihoods, and the unmitigated spread of COVID-19. The article argues that fishers’ adaptive strategies do not exclusively articulate with a changing environment but are also pragmatic responses to the long-term effects of several types of socioeconomic developments that have shifted the meanings of the seascape. The study concludes that fishers’ adaptive strategies to grapple with institutional and economic volatility must be understood as non-linear and emergent processes that simultaneously shift between the centre and the marginal borders of the globalized economic system.

"37","The crossroads of ecotourism dependency, food security and a global pandemic in Galápagos, Ecuador","Burke, A.","International esteem for Galápagos’ natural wonders and the democratization of travel have contributed to a 300% increase in annual tourist entries to the archipelago from 2000 (68,989) to 2018 (275,817). The attendant spike in tourism-related anthropogenic impact coupled with deficient infrastructure development has put the archipelago’s natural capital and carrying capacity at risk. The complex nature of Galápagos’ food insecurity is linked to the archipelago’s geographic isolation, its diminishing agricultural workforce, international tourists’ demand for recognizable food, and a lack of investment in sustainable and innovative agricultural futures. Food security is key to the long-term well-being of Galapagueños, who sustain Galápagos’ tourism industry. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed the vulnerability of human systems in Galápagos, especially the fragility of Galápagos’ ecotourism dependency. Galapagueños’ struggle to endure the tourism sector’s slow rebound following the 2020 travel restrictions points to an urgent need to implement food security measures as an indispensable component of the archipelago’s long-term sustainability plan. This article presents ethnographic data to discuss the tourism sector’s impact on local food systems, Galapagueños’ right to food sovereignty, efforts to increase agricultural production, and why strengthening institutional partnerships is vital to Galápagos’ food self-sufficiency. © 2021 by the author.

In this study we aimed at exploring the eating habits and sleep quality of the adult population of Ecuador during the mandatory confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a cross-sectional study, which used an online survey that included questions about eating habits and sleeping habits in adults (n = 9522) between 18-69 years old. The Pittsburg sleep quality questionnaire validated for the Hispanic population was used, and questions about dietary habits. The statistical test Chi-square statistical test was used to analyze the data. The results show that sleep quality differs according to sex, being worse in women, both in all components of sleep quality and in the total score (p < 0.001). Women had greater changes in the habitual consumption of food compared to men (24.24% vs. 22.53%), and people between 18 and 40 years of age decreased their food consumption in relation to people >40 years (24.06% vs. 17.73%). Our results indicate that mandatory confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ecuador has generated changes in the eating habits and sleep quality in the adult population sampled, and these changes are more noticeable in women and young adults.

"39","Drivers, Opportunities, and Challenges for Integrated Resource Co-management and Sustainable Development in Galapagos","Garcia Ferrari, S.; Bain, A. A.; Crane De Narváez, S.","The Galapagos archipelago represents an insular system with finite natural resources, a growing population, and an economy heavily weighted on tourism that leaves it vulnerable to shocks, such as the Covid-19 crisis. This work proposes an alternative scenario developed through creating intersections between water-energy-food (WEF) nexus and adaptive co-management (ACM) approaches to resource management. This framework allows the identification of novel synergies that are applied to the analysis of Galapagos as case study. Within this approach, qualitative analysis is applied to data collected via a set of interviews with local stakeholders (including community, business, third sector, and government actors) to evaluate (i) how a deeper understanding of community perceptions and needs can help to identify pathways toward more sustainable development in line with conservation goals, (ii) what governance frameworks should be implemented to promote community-based resource management and resilience, and (iii) what role education and capacitation can play in supporting alternative forms of economic activity. The research suggests that the implementation of an integrated WEF-ACM framework for resource management in Galapagos could promote resilience by opening a space for deliberation and conflict resolution between legitimate stakeholders, thus supporting more effective and balanced participative governance. The current Covid-19 crisis has led to the emergence of alternative forms of community collaboration that demonstrate the potential for a more economically diverse and more sustainable future. By placing different sources of knowledge on a level platform in such a framework, greater community ownership of resource management and conservation goals could be achieved. The incorporation of an ACM approach within the management of WEF resources would also allow Galapagueños to determine their own vision of a future sustainable socio-ecosystem, based on optimising system outcomes by co-identifying the trade-offs and synergies between the interrelated resource sectors, but requires a transformation in institutional culture.

A.; Paz, C.","This article examines the short-term effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on food security and nutrition in rural Guatemala. We rely on a comprehensive panel dataset of 1,824 small agricultural households collected over two survey rounds, on November-December 2019 and May-June 2020. We place special emphasis on changes in agricultural and nonagricultural income sources, including remittances, and changes in dietary diversity, including consumption of animal source foods (ASF) and fruits and vegetables (F&V). We find that COVID-19 affected the incomes, food security, and dietary patterns of households, with a decrease in ASF diversity and an increase in F&V diversity, and an overall net decrease in dietary diversity across all food groups. Dietary diversity among women in reproductive age, however, remained unchanged, and increased among children under 2 years old. Interestingly, households with relatively higher incomes appear to have reduced their dietary diversity to a larger extent than lower income ones, as well as households located in communities with more severe access restrictions. The focus of the study in a region with a high prevalence of poverty and chronic malnutrition provides an important perspective into the consequences of the lockdown in complex rural contexts with vulnerable populations and contributes to inform eventual recovery measures.",2021,"Agric Econ","52","3","477-494",34149131,"10.1111/agec.12629","Latin America and Caribbean"
"41","A comparative study of small-scale fishery supply chains’ vulnerability and resilience to COVID-19","Bassett, H. R.; Sharan, S.; Suri, S. K.; Advani, S.; Giordano, C.","The COVID-19 pandemic and response has significantly disrupted fishery supply chains, creating shortages of essential foods and constraining livelihoods globally. Small-scale fisheries (SSFs) are responding to the pandemic in a variety of ways. Together, disruptions from and responses to COVID-19 illuminate existing vulnerabilities in the fish distribution paradigm and possible means of reducing system and actor sensitivity and exposure and increasing adaptive capacity. Integrating concepts from literature on supply chain disruptions, social-ecological systems, human wellbeing, vulnerability, and SSFs, we synthesize preliminary lessons from six case studies from Indonesia, the Philippines, Peru, Canada, and the United States. The SSF supply chains examined employ different distribution strategies and operate in different geographic, political, social, economic, and cultural contexts. Specifically, we ask (a) how resilient have different SSF supply chains been to COVID-19 impacts; (b) what do these initial outcomes indicate about the role of distribution strategies in determining the vulnerability of SSF supply chains to macroeconomic shocks; and (c) what key factors have shaped this vulnerability? Based on our findings, systemic changes that may reduce SSF vulnerability to future macroeconomic shocks include: diversification of distribution strategies, livelihoods, and products; development of local and domestic markets and distribution channels; reduced reliance on international markets; establishment of effective communication channels; and preparation for providing aid to directly assist supply chains and support consumer purchasing power. © 2021, The Author(s).",2022,"Maritime Studies","","","",NA,"10.1007/s40152-021-00231-4","Latin America and Caribbean"

This study provides insights regarding the impacts of the pandemic in Mexican small-scale fisheries, explores community responses and digital divide. A total of 1493 interviews were conducted, and a social media analysis that reviewed 9079 posts from April to December 2020 was performed. The results show large socio-economic and environmental impacts (e.g. 89% of the markets closed in April, and 72% of respondents perceived an increase in the amount of solid waste). Women have faced increased inequalities when accessing fishing resources or healthcare. Responses have been varied and include closing communities, and fishing organizations distributing emergency funds. Fishers relate feeling very or moderately comfortable with technology and have spent more time using digital platforms during the pandemic than before. While the effects are still unfolding, there is an urgent need to breach the digital divide to guarantee equal opportunities for all. Efforts are needed to ensure that the most vulnerable groups (e.g. women, indigenous people, and elderly individuals) are not excluded from opportunities to access, use or manage resources, including technology. This global crisis may also bring opportunities for adaptation and the implementation of local solutions (e.g. reducing the fishing effort for high-value products), to prepare for future shocks. The findings in this study serve to promote development strategies that build resilience in fishing communities for healthier oceans. © 2021",2021,"Marine Policy","131","","",NA,"10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104606","Latin America and Caribbean"

Due to the sanitary measures, restrictions to travel and lock down periods, the tourist sector has been one of the economic sectors most affected by this health and economic crisis. However, it is not the only sector to have been affected, the fisheries sector, being highly dependent on the export market, has also suffered the consequences of this crisis. In this article, we aim to identify the main characteristics and key aspects of the fishing and tourist sectors in the states of Yucatan and Campeche, in Mexico, under pandemic dynamics. What are the organizational and governance structures that have been developed in response to this world phenomena? To answer this question, we conducted phone interviews and reviewed governmental and community actions. Results show that individual survival strategies prevail as a response to COVID-19, over community or governmental actions. There was limited coordination among the different governance structures, between the community and governmental levels.

Underwater soundscape variations are discussed in this study, comparing a typical and confinement day in a coastal lagoon near a popular tourist city in Mexico. Recording devices were located at 2 m in depth and 430 m away from the main promenade-a two-way avenue for light vehicle traffic-where main tourist infrastructure is located. The nearby marine environment is habitat to birds and dolphins as well as fish and invertebrates of commercial importance. Medium and small boats usually transit the area. The main underwater sound level reduction was measured at low frequencies (10-2000 Hz) because of the decrease in roadway noise. Vessel traffic also decreased by almost three quarters, although the level reduction due to this source was less noticeable. As typical day levels in the roadway noise band can potentially mask fish sounds and affect other low frequency noise-sensitive marine taxa, this study suggests that comprehensive noise analysis in coastal marine environments should consider the contribution from nearby land sources.",2021,"J Acoust Soc Am","149","1","652",33514174,"10.1121/10.0003354","Latin America and Caribbean"

The necessary measures implemented during the lockdown worldwide to contain the Covid-19 pandemic altered these consumer practices. This paper examines how household's culinary traditions and food management have changed in Mexico as a result of Covid-related restrictions, and their impact on food waste. We obtained 525 answers using an online survey about food habits distributed through social networks in Mexico between December 2020 and January 2021. The results show that the participating households increased their monetary expenditure on groceries and reduced food waste during the pandemic. The estimation of consumer responsiveness to waste, through the introduction of a framework based on a Quadratic Almost-Ideal Demand System, confirms that, even more during the lockdown, food waste has become a luxury good. The analysis of food category changes allows for a detailed study useful to curtail the level of food waste in Mexican households and to encourage transition towards sustainable and circular consumption behaviors. © 2021 The Authors",2021,"Socio-Economic Planning Sciences","","","",NA,"10.1016/j.seps.2021.101065","Latin America and Caribbean"

P.; Rodrigues, H.; Franco-Luesma, E.; Saldaña, E.; Valentin, D.","The coronavirus outbreak in December 2019 completely changed the dynamic of consumption in different sectors of industry. The food and beverage industries have been profoundly affected, from production, to modifications in consumers' choices. Among the different reasons behind those modifications is confinement, which forces consumers to stay at home for an extended period and just go out to perform essential tasks, such as going to the supermarket. We hypothesized that this new dynamic of consumption could create a situation of fear that changes food choice. To test this hypothesis, two studies were conducted in three countries with a different degree of confinement: Mexico (flexible), Spain (strict), and Peru (hard). Study one consisted of a free association task with 60 participants in each country with the inductor word ""coronavirus and food"". The different associations served as the basis to build a structured questionnaire, which was used in the second study focused on fear and food choice. The second study was applied to 450 participants in the same three countries. Results showed that fear can be separated into nine dimensions: social, emotional, food supply, government, basic needs, food-delivery, overeating, immunity, and family conflicts. The participants could also be clustered into four different groups that differ in their country of origin and sex, but also in their food choice.

Economic reasons to transition to secure tenure and active co-management of the jumbo flying squid artisanal fishery in Peru","Gozzer-Wuest, R.; Alonso-Población, E.; Rojas-Perea, S.; Roa-Ureta, R. H.","The Peruvian artisanal squid fleet accounts for more than 45% of the worldwide landings of the jumbo flying squid (JFS) fishery, the largest invertebrate fishery worldwide. Nevertheless, most vessels involved in the fishery lack secure tenure rights and operate within the informal economy. Interviews and a survey directed to shipowners allowed identification of three economic regimes under which the fleet operates and estimation of annual operating costs, revenues, and added value. Our results show that the fishery has high economic importance in Peru, accounting annually for 9–15% of the total Peruvian fisheries sector's GDP. Even during 2020, highly impacted by the COVID-19, the fishery was profitable and maintained economic accounts not substantially below of previous years. Furthermore, public data on landings and off-vessel and export prices were used to model the impact of supply on price elasticity for fishers and exporters in Peru and Chile. Data showed steep declines in off-vessel prices with increasing supply for Peruvian fishers. Conversely, Peruvian exporters and Chilean fishers and exporters mostly retained stable prices at nearly all supply levels. The paper suggests that the informal status of the Peruvian JFS fishing activity, which lacks co-management mechanisms, is amongst the co-factors explaining the different price elasticity suffered by the Peruvian fishers. In view of the results, we suggest that speeding up the granting of secure tenure rights to the acting operative artisanal fleet and prompt development of co-management arrangements has the potential to bring environmental and economic gains for fishers. © 2021 The Authors",2022,"Marine Policy","136","","",NA,"10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104886","Latin America and Caribbean"

Countries around the world have implemented various types of blockades to stop this infection. These health measures have led to a significant reduction in air pollution. However, the impact of these measures on aquatic environments has been little analyzed. In this context, the water quality of rivers in the Mantaro River basin was evaluated using multivariate statistical methods and heavy metal contamination indices during the health crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic. Surface water samples were collected in triplicate from 15 sampling sectors at the end of the rainy season, between March and April. Concentrations of Cu, Fe, Pb, Zn and As were determined by the method of atomic absorption flame spectrophotometry. The average concentrations of heavy metals and arsenic in the rivers evaluated did not exceed the environmental quality standards for drinking water of the Peruvian, WHO and US EPA regulations, except for Pb, Fe and As in the Mantaro River and As in the Chia River. PCA presented a total variation percentage of 83.8%. The results showed a clear positive relationship between the five heavy metals and metalloids. The hierarchical cluster analysis according to Spearman’s correlation generated a dendrogram where the five chemical elements were grouped in two statistically significant groups, one group conglomerating to Cu, Pb, Zn and Fe and the other group to As. PERMANOVA partition shows that the spatial effects of the sectors are strong and significant. The HPI revealed that 13.33% of the sampling sectors exceeded the critical contamination value (150).

"56","Impacts of COVID-19 on the value chain of the hake small scale fishery in northern Peru","Grillo-Núñez, J.; Mendo, T.; Gozzer-Wuest, R.; Mendo, J.","All aspects of fish supply chains have been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with jobs, income and food security at risk. In Peru, small scale fisheries are fundamental for food security, contributing to about 2/3 of all fish consumed nationally. One of the most important resources which is more affordable for local and regional consumption is hake (Merluccius gayi peruanus). This study is a first attempt to describe the small-scale hake fishery value chain and to quantify the impact of COVID-19 from March to August 2020 in two fishing communities in northern Peru. The levels of fishing and primary buying were the most affected, and we estimate that ~ 23,000 fishing trips were not conducted, ~ 1680 t of hake was not landed (83% decrease), and 620 jobs were negatively impacted during this period. The gross income of vessel owners and primary buyers decreased by ~ $US 913,000. Marked differences were observed in the way each community responded to the pandemic and in their resilience to cope with COVID-19, despite being located less than 10 km away. In El Ñuro, which relied more heavily on the international market for hake trade, the value chain was affected for longer, while in Los Órganos which supplied national markets, the chain was restored after an initial period of adjustment. Our study suggests that government efforts should focus on facilitating a formalisation process in all levels of the chain, develop indicators to monitor the resumption of activities and the inclusion of a value chain approach to small-scale fisheries management. © 2021 The Authors",2021,"Marine Policy","134","","",NA,"10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104808","Latin America and Caribbean"

FI was assessed using the Food Insecurity Experience Scale. Household characteristics were collected before and during the COVID-19 outbreak in Peru to characterise participants' vulnerability to FI. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between government support and participants' vulnerability characteristics to FI. During the period under study (March to December 2020), 24% (95% CI: 22.1-25.9%) of the participants experienced FI. Families in the top wealth tercile were 49% less likely to experience FI. Larger families (>5 members) and those with increased household expenses and decreased income due to COVID-19 were more likely to experience FI (by 35%, 39% and 42%, respectively). There was no significant association between government support and FI (p = 0.768). We conclude that pre-pandemic socioeconomic status, family size, and the economic disruption during COVID-19 contribute to the risk of FI among the Peruvian young population, while government support insufficiently curtailed the risk to these households.",2021,"Nutrients","13","10","",34684547,"10.3390/nu13103546","Latin America and Caribbean"

The government implemented house confinement measures with probable consequences on lifestyle, particularly affecting eating habits, physical activity, sleep quality, and mental health. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the lifestyles, physical activity, and sleep characteristics, as well as changes in eating habits in a Peruvian population during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was performed. We analyzed Peruvian adults based on an online self-administered questionnaire divided into sociodemographic, anthropometrics, COVID-19 diagnosis reported, lifestyle habits, and frequency of consumption of foods. RESULTS: During confinement for COVID-19, 1176 participants were studied. Of these, most reported weight gain (1 to 3 kg) and 35.7% were overweight. The lifestyles habits showed that 54.8% reported doing physical activity and 37.2% sleep less. The Peruvian sample presented a main meal pattern of breakfast (95.7%), lunch (97.5%), and dinner (89.1%). Likewise, eating habits before and during COVID-19 pandemic showed that vegetables (OR:1.56, CI95% 1.21-200), fruit (OR: 1.42, CI95% 1.10-1.81), legumes (OR:1.67, CI95% 1.23-2.28), and eggs (OR: 2.00, CI95% 1.52-2.65) presented significant consumption increase during social isolation, while bakery products (OR: 0.74, CI95% 0.56-0.97), meat, snack, refreshment, and fast food decreased in consumption. Other foods showed no significant differences. CONCLUSION: This study showed an important frequency of overweight and sleep changes.

In Latin America, both Brazil and Peru reported the highest levels of impact in terms of proportional infection and death rates. Within this context, this study sought to compare food consumption and wastage patterns in Peruvian and Brazilian households. For these purposes, the authors conducted a quantitative research study based on a self-reported online survey submitted during the pandemic outbreak. Results revealed that the intention of reducing food wastage and implementing leftover management routines are related to the economic value of wasted food. In addition, in both countries, shopping lists are used as planning elements, and food purchases are influenced by on-sale products. Leftover management is also similar in both countries, and the expiration date on the label is the most commonly used criterion for consuming or discarding food items. Nevertheless, within the framework of the health and economic crisis generated, opportunities for change toward the adoption of smarter and more sustainable purchasing behaviors are emerging for both households and companies, in addition to giving equal importance to environmental, social, and economic benefits. This research study provided insights into food consumption and food wastage behaviors in times of crisis, such as a pandemic. © 2021 by the authors.

"61","Preliminary lessons from COVID-19 disruptions of small-scale fishery supply chains","Bassett, Hannah R.; Lau, Jacqueline; Giordano, Christopher; Suri, Sharon K.; Advani, Sahir; Sharan, Sonia","• COVID-19 and associated mitigation measures have disrupted small-scale fishery (SSF) supply chains. • Case studies of SSF supply chains' responses to the pandemic examined to consider their adaptive capacity and resilience. • Shift from global to local distribution channels observed across all case studies. • Pre-existing networks and digital technology facilitated this shift. • Over-reliance on global supply chains leads to inherent vulnerabilities. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and associated mitigation measures have disrupted global systems that support the health, food and nutrition security, and livelihoods of billions of people. These disruptions have likewise affected the small-scale fishery (SSF) sector, disrupting SSF supply chains and exposing weaknesses in the global seafood distribution system. To inform future development of adaptive capacity and resilience in the sector, it is important to understand how supply chain actors are responding in the face of a macroeconomic shock. Comparing across seven SSF case studies in four countries, we explore how actors are responding to COVID-19 disruptions, identify constraints to adaptive responses, and describe patterns of disruption and response across cases. In all cases examined, actors shifted focus to local and regional distribution channels and particularly drew on flexibility, organization, and learning to re-purpose pre-existing networks and use technology to their advantage. Key constraints to reaching domestic consumers included domestic restrictions on movement and labor, reduced spending power amongst domestic consumers, and lack of existing distribution channels. In addition, the lack of recognition of SSFs as essential food-producers and inequities in access to technology hampered efforts to continue local seafood supply. We suggest that the initial impacts from COVID-19 highlight the risks in of over-reliance on global trade networks. The SSFs that were able to change strategies most successfully had local organizations and connections in place that they leveraged in innovative ways. As such, supporting local and domestic networks and flexible organizations within the supply chain may help build resilience in the face of future macroeconomic shocks. Importantly, bolstering financial wellbeing and security within the domestic market both before and during such large-scale disruptions is crucial for supporting ongoing supply chain operations and continued food provision during macroeconomic crises.

D.; Sivapalan, S.","Apart from the health aspects and the high death toll, the COVID-19 pandemic has, since its official recognition in March 2020 caused may social and economic problems. It has also led to many environmental ones. For instance, the lockdowns have led to higher levels of consumption of packaged products, and of take-away food. This paper reports on an international study on the increased consumption and subsequent changes in the amounts of waste produced since the COVID-19 pandemic. The results show that 45-48% of the respondents observed an increased consumption of packed food, fresh food, and food delivery. One of the main reasons for the increased waste generation during the lockdown was the fact that people have spent more time at home. In addition, increases of 43% and 53% in food waste and plastic packaging. Drawing from comparisons on the amount of domestic waste produced before and during the pandemic, the findings suggest that some specific types of municipal waste have visibly increased, putting additional pressure on waste management systems. This characterises one of non-intended effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results from this study provide useful insights to city administrations and municipal utilities on consumption patterns during emergency situations. This, in turn, may support more systemic and strategic measures to be taken, so as to curtail the increase of household waste during pandemic situations.",2021,"Sci Total Environ","777","","145997",33676209,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145997","Latin America and Caribbean"

An exploration of the factors that moderate the impact of the pandemic on eating habits in Uruguay","Vidal, L.; Brunet, G.; Curutchet, M. R.; Girona, A.; Pardiñas, V.; Guerra, D.; Platero, E.; Machado, L.; González, F.; Gugliucci, V.; Ares, G.","In May 2020, Uruguay was one of the few Latin American countries that had managed to control the outbreak of COVID-19 without mandatory curfews or quarantines. However, several social distancing measures created a major disruption in different aspects of the daily life of Uruguayan citizens. In this context, the objectives of the present work were i) to identify changes in eating habits perceived by Uruguayan citizens as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, and ii) to explore factors associated with different perceived changes on eating habits. A cross-sectional online study was conducted with 891 participants, recruited using an advertisement on Facebook and Instagram. Fifty-one percent of the participants indicated that their eating habits had changed since the detection of the first cases of COVID-19 in Uruguay. Large heterogeneity in the categorization of the changes existed: 45% of the participants regarded the changes as positive, 32% as negative and 23% as neither positive nor negative. A multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to study the influence of explanatory variables in the likelihood of belonging to groups who reported different changes in eating habits (no changes, positive, negative, or neither positive nor negative changes). Household income and reliance on instrumental and emotional support increased the likelihood of reporting positive changes in eating habits, whereas negative changes were associated with a reduction in household income due to COVID-19 and the coping strategies self-distraction and self-blaming. Insights for policy making to reinforce positive effects and minimize threats to healthy eating are discussed.",2021,"Appetite","167","","105651",34400222,"10.1016/j.appet.2021.105651","Latin America and Caribbean"

"68","Dietary Changes and Anxiety during the Coronavirus Pandemic: Differences between the Sexes","Boaz, M.; Navarro, D. A.; Raz, O.; Kaufman-Shriqui, V.","The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has been associated with both increased anxiety, deterioration in diet and weight gain. These associations may differ by sex. The present report examines differences by sex in diet quality in order to determine whether associations between diet and psychological stress during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic differed by sex. This online study is available internationally in seven languages. The Mediterranean Diet Score was used to measure diet quality, while the General Anxiety Disorder 7-point scale (GAD-7) was used to measure anxiety. Findings were compared by self-reported sex (male vs. female). A total of 3797 respondents provided informed consent and met eligibility criteria, of whom 526 women were omitted due to being pregnant or six months or less post-partum, or due to reproductive status not being reported. Thus, 3271 individuals are included in the present report, of whom 71.2% were women. The median age of women was 30 (interquartile range (IQR) = 16) years vs. 31 (IQR = 19) years, p = 0.079. The median diet quality score was 9 (IQ = 3) in both women and men (p = 0.75). Despite the overall similarity in diet score, several components of the score differed significantly by sex. Women reported consuming significantly more olive oil, daily servings of vegetables, and weekly servings of sweet baked goods. Men reported consuming significantly more sweetened/carbonated drinks, red meat, alcohol, legumes, and hummus/tahini. Women reported a GAD-7 score of 6 (IQR = 8), while men reported 3 (6), p < 0.001. An inverse association was detected between the Mediterranean diet score and the GAD-7 score in both women (rho = -0.166, p < 0.001) and men (rho = -0.154, p < 0.001), and the correlation coefficients did not differ by sex (p = 0.76). Mediterranean diet score and age both reduced the odds of elevated anxiety (GAD-7 ≥ 10), while female sex, deterioration of diet quality during the outbreak, unemployment, and completing the survey in English increased the odds of this outcome. During the COVID-19 lockdowns, overall diet quality did not differ by sex; however, some differences by sex in components of the total score were detected. Moderate to severe anxiety was positively associated with female sex and poorer diet quality even after controlling for age, employment status, and the language in which the survey was performed.",2021,"Nutrients","13","12","",34959744,"10.3390/nu13124193","Latin America and Caribbean"
"69","Consumer experiences of food environments during the Covid-19 pandemic: Global insights from a rapid online survey of individuals from 119 countries","O'Meara, L.; Turner, C.; Coitinho, D. C.; Oenema, S.","This study investigates consumer experiences of food environments and food acquisition practices during the Covid-19 pandemic. Our rapid assessment online survey featured a convenience sample of 2015 individuals from 119 countries, spanning Western Europe, North America, Latin America, Asia-Pacific, and Africa. Data collection took place in April 2020 during the second month of the pandemic. Participants were recruited via existing networks of the United Nations System Standing Committee on Nutrition, through social media, and by snowballing. The majority of participants were female (71.9%), from low- and middle-income countries (51.0%), and working in nutrition or healthcare (39.3%). Qualitative thematic analysis and descriptive statistics reveal a series of common global experiences related to food availability and accessibility, food prices and affordability, food acquisition practices, and food preparation and consumption. The importance of community food participation, food sharing, and resource allocation are highlighted, along with increasing awareness of healthy diets and food waste. We identify ten synergistic policy entry points to: 1) build resilient and equitable food environments resistant to stresses and shocks; 2) harness positive dietary-related behaviors manifested during the pandemic; and, 3) mitigate the projected nutrition crisis and promote sustainable healthy diets for all.",2022,"Glob Food Sec","32","","100594",34812406,"10.1016/j.gfs.2021.100594","Latin America and Caribbean"

R.; Vos, R.; Zilberman, D.","Coronavirus disease 2019 and related lockdown policies in 2020 shocked food industry firms' supply chains in developing regions. Firms ""pivoted"" to e-commerce to reach consumers and e-procurement to reach processors and farmers. ""Delivery intermediaries"" copivoted with food firms to help them deliver and procure. This was crucial to the ability of the food firms to pivot. The pandemic was a ""crucible"" that induced this set of fast-tracking innovations, accelerating the diffusion of e-commerce and delivery intermediaries, and enabling food industry firms to redesign, at least temporarily, and perhaps for the long term, their supply chains to be more resilient, and to weather the pandemic, supply consumers, and contribute to food security. We present a theoretical model to explain these firm strategies, and then apply the framework to classify firms' practical strategies. We focus on cases in Asia and Latin America. Enabling policy and infrastructural conditions allowed firms to pivot and copivot fluidly.",2021,"Agric Econ","52","3","459-475",34230730,"10.1111/agec.12631","Latin America and Caribbean"

V.; Fernández-Severini, M. D.","The propagation of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide has been alarming in the last months. According to recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO), the use of face masks is essential for slowing down the transmission rate of COVID-19 in human beings. This pandemic has generated a substantial increase in the use, as well as in the production, of face masks and other elements (gloves, face protectors, protective suits, safety shoes) manufactured with polymeric materials, including antiviral textiles most of which will end as microplastic pools. Focusing on South America, the use and mismanagement of this type of personal protective equipment (PPE) represents an environmental problem. Added to this issue are the increase in the use of single-use plastic, and the reduction of plastic recycling due to the curfew generated by the pandemic, further aggravating plastic pollution on coasts and beaches. Recently, researchers have developed antiviral polymeric textile technology composed of Ag and Cu nanoparticles for PPE to reduce the contagion and spread of COVID-19. Antiviral polymeric textile wastes could also have long-term negative repercussions on aquatic environments, as they are an important emerging class of contaminants. For this reason, this work provides reflections and perspectives on how the COVID-19 pandemic can aggravate plastic pollution on beaches and coastal environments, consequently increasing the damage to marine species in the coming years. In addition, the potential impact of the pandemic on waste management systems is discussed here, as well as future research directions to improve integrated coastal management strategies.",2021,"Sci Total Environ","763","","144365",33360513,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.144365","Latin America and Caribbean"
"72","Co-designing a safe ocean in the western tropical atlantic within the framework of the UN decade of ocean science for sustainable development","von Hillebrandt-Andrade, C.; Blythe-Mallett, A.; Escobar-Briones, E.","The frequency and intensity of ocean related hazards and its overlapping and cascading effects are escalating with devastating and unsustainable impact on life and livelihoods in the Western Tropical Atlantic. From the Bahamas to Brazil, from Mexico and Central America to the Lesser Antilles, coastal and maritime communities have been impacted by hurricanes, storm surges, earthquakes, sargassum and oil spills along with other climate, weather and human induced events. In addition to the coastal impacts, ocean hazards also have affected the safe and timely delivery of goods and services in a region that is extremely dependent on maritime transport. COVID-19 has compounded even more the situation of millions of people in the region and put extreme pressure on government officials, including disaster management and health professionals as well as the maritime industry. Climate change will only exacerbate the situation. The UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021-2030) presents itself as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to stop the cycle of disasters with “A Safe Ocean” as one of its seven major societal outcomes. The Western Tropical Atlantic Safe Ocean Working Group was established to co-design and co-deliver with local, national and regional partners transformative strategies that will facilitate and inspire actions to reduce and mitigate the ocean related threats while creating resilient and safer coastal communities and maritime activities. At the core is an Integrated Multi Hazard Ocean Data and Forecast System. Its services would be linked to education, outreach, readiness and communication that empowers and recognizes national and local policy decisions and includes individual response for the protection of life and livelihoods. This effort should support relevant science and strengthen capacity leaving no one or country behind. © 2021 The authors.",2021,"Ocean and Coastal Research","69","","",NA,"10.1590/2675-2824069.21-027cvha","Latin America and Caribbean"
