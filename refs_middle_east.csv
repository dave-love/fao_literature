S.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread globally, forcing countries to apply lockdowns and strict social distancing measures. The aim of this study was to assess eating habits and lifestyle behaviours among residents of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region during the lockdown. A cross-sectional study among adult residents of the MENA region was conducted using an online questionnaire designed on Google Forms during April 2020. A total of 2970 participants from eighteen countries participated in the present study. During the pandemic, over 30 % reported weight gain, 6·2 % consumed five or more meals per d compared with 2·2 % before the pandemic (P < 0·001) and 48·8 % did not consume fruits on a daily basis. Moreover, 39·1 % did not engage in physical activity, and over 35 % spent more than 5 h/d on screens. A significant association between the frequency of training during the pandemic and the reported change in weight was found (P < 0·001). A significantly higher percentage of participants reported physical and emotional exhaustion, irritability and tension either all the time or a large part of the time during the pandemic (P < 0·001). Although a high percentage of participants reported sleeping more hours per night during the pandemic, 63 % had sleep disturbances. The study highlights that the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic caused a variety of lifestyle changes, physical inactivity and psychological problems among adults in the MENA region.",2021,"Br J Nutr","126","5","757-766",33198840,"10.1017/s0007114520004547","Middle East"

"4","Estimating marine plastic pollution from COVID-19 face masks in coastal regions","Chowdhury, H.; Chowdhury, T.; Sait, S. M.","Face masks are playing an essential role in preventing the spread of COVID-19. Face masks such as N95, and surgical masks, contain a considerable portion of non-recyclable plastic material. Marine plastic pollution is likely to increase due to the rapid use and improper dispensing of face masks, but until now, no extensive quantitative estimation exists for coastal regions. Linking behaviour dataset on face mask usage and solid waste management dataset, this study estimates annual face mask utilization and plastic pollution from mismanaged face masks in coastal regions of 46 countries. It is estimated that approximately 0.15 million tons to 0.39 million tons of plastic debris could end up in global oceans within a year. With lower waste management facilities, the number of plastic debris entering the ocean will rise. Significant investments are required from global communities in improving the waste management facilities for better disposal of masks and solid waste.",2021,"Mar Pollut Bull","168","","112419",33930644,"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.112419","Middle East"
"5","COVID-19 and small enterprises in the food supply chain: Early impacts and implications for longer-term food system resilience in low- and middle-income countries","Nordhagen, Stella; Igbeka, Uduak; Rowlands, Hannah; Shine, Ritta Sabbas; Heneghan, Emily; Tench, Jonathan","Food and nutrition security play an essential role in weathering and overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic—and in achieving sustainable development. In most low- and middle-income countries, micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) play an essential role in food supply chains and thus in ensuring food and nutrition security. However, limited attention has been paid to how these critical food system actors are being impacted by the pandemic and associated measures. This paper helps fill that gap through analysis of data from 367 agri-food MSMEs in 17 countries, collected in May 2020 and capturing early impacts of the pandemic on their operations. About 94.3% of respondents reported that their firm's operations had been impacted by the pandemic, primarily through decreased sales as well as lower access to inputs and financing amid limited financial reserves. Difficulty with staffing was also widely cited. Eighty-four percent of firms reported changing their production volume as a result of the pandemic; of these, about 13% reported stopping production and about 82% reported decreasing production. Approximately 54% had changed product prices as a result of the pandemic. The probability of being severely impacted was significantly higher for firms with <50,000 USD in annual turnover; a larger decrease in consumer mobility for grocery/pharmacy shopping also increased the probability of a severe impact. Surprisingly, the youngest firms and those with the fewest employees (controlling for turnover) were less likely to be severely impacted. Over 80% of firms had taken actions to mitigate the pandemic's impact on their operations and/or staff, and about 44% were considering exploring new business areas, with some seeing opportunities for growth. We conclude by discussing implications for policy responses to address immediate challenges as well as increase long-term food system resilience to support further progress towards sustainable development.

"6","Unlocking challenges and opportunities presented by COVID-19 pandemic for cross-cutting disruption in agri-food and green deal innovations: Quo Vadis?","Rowan, N. J.; Galanakis, C. M.","COVID-19 pandemic is on a trajectory to cause catastrophic global upheaval with the potential to alter geopolitical and socio-economic norms. Many countries are frantically responding with staggering financial stimulus recovery initiatives. This opinion-paper reviews challenges, opportunities, and potential solutions for the post-COVID-19 era that focuses on intensive sustaining of agri-food supply chain in tandem with meeting the high demand for new green deal innovation. For example, the development of wet peatland innovation, known as Paludiculture, can intensively sustain and blend agri-food and green innovations that will help support COVID-19 pandemic transitioning. The future looks bright for the creation of new sustainability multi-actor innovation hubs that will support, connect, and enable businesses to recover and pivot beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. The nexus between first 'Green Deal' initiative supporting 64 selected European Startups and SMEs (European Innovation Council) and 43 Irish Disruptive Technology projects are addressed in the context of cross-cutting developments and relevance to COVID-19. Candidate areas for future consideration will focus on climate action, digitization, manufacturing, and sustainable food production, security, and waste mitigation.

We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the impact of national lockdowns on adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (MD). METHODS: Studies were identified searching Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. Studies published until 4th May 2021 were included. We only considered studies reporting original data from quantitative analysis and assessing changes in adherence to the MD, using validated dietary scores, or in consumption of MD food items. Data extraction, pooling, and quality appraisal of included studies were conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS: Forty-two studies were retrieved. After screening, 12 studies met inclusion criteria and were included in the review, of which 4 (33%) were longitudinal studies. Six (85.7%) of the seven studies that measured changes in MD adherence before-during lockdown reported an increase (rate of change of high-adherence to MD ranged between +3.3% and +21.9%). Evidence indicates that consumption of MD food items increased during lockdown but is heterogeneous in study design, quality, and findings. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest adherence to the MD during lockdown might have increased in some settings, while the determinants of such a trend are to be further explored. We raise awareness of the need to research further the impacts and long-term consequences of COVID-19 containment measures on dietary and lifestyle habits.",2021,"Acta Biomed","92","S6","e2021440",34739464,"10.23750/abm.v92iS6.12233","Middle East"

H.; Okasha, S. A.; Ghozy, S.; Islam, S. M. S.","BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has affected health and lifestyle behaviors of people globally. This project aims to identify the impact of COVID-19 on lifestyle behavior of individuals in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region during confinement. METHODS: We conducted an online survey in 17 countries (Egypt, Jordan, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Yemen, Syria, Palestine, Algeria, Morocco, Libya, Tunisia, Iraq, and Sudan) from the MENA region on August and September 2020. The questionnaire included self-reported information on lifestyle behaviors, including physical activity, eating habits, smoking, watching television, social media use and sleep before and during the pandemic. Logistic regression was performed to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on lifestyle behaviors. RESULTS: A total of 5896 participants were included in the final analysis and 62.8% were females. The BMI of the participants was 25.4 ± 5.8 kg/m(2). Around 38.4% of the participants stopped practicing any physical activities during the confinement (P < 0.001), and 57.1% reported spending more than 2 h on social media (P < 0.001). There were no significant changes in smoking habits. Also, 30.9% reported an improvement in their eating habits compared with 24.8% reported worsening of their eating habits. Fast-food consumption decreased significantly in 48.8% of the study population. This direct/indirect exposure to COVID-19 was associated with an increased consumption of carbohydrates (OR = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.02-1.17; P = 0.01), egg (OR = 1.08; 95% CI = 1.02-1.16; P = 0.01), sugar (OR = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.02-1.16; P = 0.02), meat, and poultry (OR = 1.13; 95% CI = 1.06-1.20; P < 0.01). There was also associated increase in hours spent on watching television (OR = 1.07; 95% CI = 1.02-1.12; P < 0.01) and social media (OR = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.01-1.18; P = 0.03). However, our results showed a reduction in sleeping hours among those exposed to COVID-19 infection (OR = 0.85; 95% CI = 0.77-0.94; P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with an increase in food consumption and sedentary life. Being exposed to COVID-19 by direct infection or through an infected household is a significant predictor of amplifying these changes. Public health interventions are needed to address healthy lifestyle behaviors during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.",2021,"J Transl Med","19","1","129",33785043,"10.1186/s12967-021-02767-9","Middle East"

A.; Jalali, M.; Mosallanezhad, Z.; Karamizadeh, M.","BACKGROUND: Significant lifestyle changes have been reported after COVID-19 outbreak. The present study aimed at investigating changes in dietary habits in response to the COVID-19 outbreak in an Iranian population sample. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, the dietary habits of Iranian adults were assessed before and during the COVID-19 outbreak. Consumption of different food groups such as meats, dairy, fruits, vegetables, seeds, and nuts was assessed using a digital questionnaire which was shared on social media platforms. For the statistical analysis, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used. RESULTS: In this online survey, 1553 questionnaires were completed. The results showed that the reported consumption of protein-rich foods increased (P < 0.05), but fish and dairy consumption showed a significant reduction (P = 0.006 and <0.001, respectively). There was a significant reduction in reported fast-food consumption (P < 0.001). Fruits and vegetables (P < 0.001), natural fruit juices (P < 0.001), and water (P < 0.001) were consumed more frequently. Individuals also consumed more vitamin and mineral supplements (P < 0.001) including those containing Vitamin D. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, participants reported a significant change in their dietary habits and intake of supplements.

"11","The short-term effects of COVID-19 outbreak on dietary diversity and food security status of Iranian households (A case study in Tehran province)","Pakravan-Charvadeh, M. R.; Mohammadi-Nasrabadi, F.; Gholamrezai, S.; Vatanparast, H.; Flora, C.; Nabavi-Pelesaraei, A.","Currently, the COVID-19 outbreak is spreading fast in 185 countries and has engaged most people around the world. COVID-19 imposes severe and tragic consequences on people's health due to the high rate of spread and potentially fatal impacts. In this study, the association of socio-economic factors with food security and dietary diversity is assessed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from 299 respondents were collected by an online standard questionnaire. Household Dietary Diversity Score (HDDS) and Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) were calculated. A multinomial regression model was applied to determine factors associated with HDDS and HFIAS before and during COVID-19 outbreak. Food security of Iranian households improved during the initial COVID-19 pandemic period (P < 0.001). Households reduced consumption of some food groups during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. Key socio-economic factors associated with food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic included personal savings, household income, employment status of head of household, and nutrition knowledge of head of household. During the COVID-19 outbreak, household size, head of household's occupation, personal savings, and number of male children were significantly associated with dietary diversity. Distributing free food baskets to poor households, extending e-marketing, providing nutrition consultations, and organizing donations to support infected households may increase household dietary diversity and improve food security status during a pandemic such as COVID-19. Vulnerable populations in countries experiencing food insecurity, such as Iran, should be supported - not just by providing medical care and personal protective equipment, but also with flexible safety nets and food-based intervention programs to respond to population needs.",2021,"J Clean Prod","281","","124537",33052173,"10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.124537","Middle East"

H.","The first case of COVID-19 was reported in December 2019, and then the virus has spread throughout the world, which led to lockdown in different countries, including Iran. Restrictions on transportation and travel of personnel caused some shortages in aquaculture, particularly in shrimp farms. This study aims to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the shrimp farming industry in Iran. An online questionnaire was designed to collect information from shrimp farmers, material suppliers, food preparing factories, managers of shrimp hatchery centers, and shrimp exporters. Our results showed that the COVID-19 outbreak has significantly decreased the shrimp annual sales, export, and price in Iran. Also, the production of larvae was affected by COVID-19.

"14","The impact of COVID-19 confinement on the eating habits and lifestyle changes: A cross sectional study","Galali, Y.","Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, China causing severe respiratory infections and resulting in millions admissions to hospital and over a million deaths worldwide. Authorities imposed protective measures including confinement to flatten curves of casualties resulted in sudden lifestyle and eating habit changes. The objectives of this study were to observe the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on eating behavior and lifestyle of the Kurdish population in Iraqi Kurdistan. A structured cross-sectional study was conducted from 1st to 14th of June when the lockdown finished with three different sections. Section one (6 questions) included socio-demographic information section two (11 questions) composed of dietary behavior information including a) Mediterranean diet (MD) adherence using 14-scaled items with a MD screener tool ranging from 0 to 14 b) and sections three (12 questions) composed of lifestyle habit changes such as physical activity, sleeping behavior, and smoking habit. The total number of included respondents was 2,137. The results showed that 12.0% (256) of participants stated that their lifestyle was improved, whereas 50.9% (1,087) declared their lifestyle deteriorated. In particular, the frequency of physical activity was decreased (McNemar value = 60.53, p <.001) and sleeping hours were significantly increased during lockdown (McNemar value = 447.93, p <.001). Regarding eating habits, it was noticed that 29.3% and 14.3% felt that appetite increased and decreased, respectively. The appetite change during lockdown was significantly associated with age (p =.0001), gender (p =.001), city (p =.007), and BMI (p =.001). Similarly, 32.4% reported weight gain.

Here, we collected fish diversity data from coral reefs at the Israeli Gulf of Aqaba during and after the COVID-19 lockdown. We examined beach entrances to the reef, nearby shallow reefs and deeper areas exposed mostly to divers. We found that the lockdown elicited a behavioral response that resulted in elevated species richness at designated reef entrances, predominantly influenced by increased evenness without changes to total abundances. This effect was observed both at the local scale and when several beach entrances were aggregated together. Consequently, non-extractive human activities may have substantial short-term impacts on fish diversity. Our insights could help designate guidelines to manage visitor impacts on coral reefs and aid in their prolonged persistence. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,"Biological Conservation","257","","",NA,"10.1016/j.biocon.2021.109103","Middle East"

Gaza suffers from a blockade imposed by the Israeli occupation, environmental deterioration, confiscation of lands, demolition of houses and hospitals, restrictions on movement, lack of control over natural resources, and financial constraints. Gaza's population is consequently living in a poor humanitarian situation with high unemployment rates, poverty, over-crowdedness, and a weak health system. This makes Gaza incredibly fragile and affects its ability to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic effectively. The pandemic is expected to deepen Gaza's systems' fragility, which is already overstretched beyond their limits. This will hinder its capacity to deal with the pandemic, and other pre-existing pressing humanitarian needs. Therefore, in this review, we comprehensively explored Gaza's policy failures and successes related to the COVID-19 preparedness and response by state and non-state actors and recommend potential solutions and alternatives. We have addressed critical issues including the health system, water, sanitation, hygiene, socio-economic, education, food security, and others.

"17","Eating habits among primary and secondary school students in the Gaza Strip, Palestine: A cross-sectional study during the COVID-19 pandemic","Radwan, A.; Radwan, E.; Radwan, W.","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has a great impact on the eating habits, dietary intake, and purchasing behaviours of students. At this critical moment, there is an urgent need to identify the eating habits of school students, in particular, who live in low-income countries, during the lockdown period. Therefore, the present study aims to identify the influence of COVID-19 on the eating habits, quality and quantity of food intake among school students in the Gaza Strip, Palestine. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out among 2398 primary and secondary school students aged 6-18 year old through an online questionnaire which included questions on socio-demographic, eating habits as well as quality and quantity of food intake. Students over the age of 11 years completed the questionnaire on their own, whereas for students under the age of 12 years, the students' guardians were instructed to answer the questionnaire on their behalf. A Wilcoxon Signed-Rank and McNemar tests were applied to perform a comparison between general dietary habits before and during COVID-19. Also, a Wilcoxon Signed Rank test was used to compare the median scores of food quality and quantity before and during the COVID-19 pandemic based on student's sociodemographic. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a significant increase in eating home-cooked foods (91.6%), avoiding ordering food from outside per week (93.3%) and buying groceries online (7.7%) (p < 0.001). There was a marked increase in the students reporting fear about food hygiene outside the home from 20.8% before COVID-19 to 72.9% during the COVID-19 period (p < 0.001). The results showed that the median score for food quality during the COVID-19 pandemic (11.0/6.0) was significantly higher than the before COVID-19 period (10.0, IQR = 8.0) (p < 0.001). The results revealed that the median score for food quantity before the COVID-19 pandemic (15.0, IQR = 5.0) was significantly higher than the during COVID-19 pandemic (14.0, IQR = 7.0) (p < 0.001). The results showed significant differences between the before and during COVID-19 period for food quality and quantity across socio-demographic variables (gender, age group, parent's highest level of education, monthly household income, and household size). During the COVID-19 pandemic, students from a high-income and a small size family had the highest score in terms of food quality and quantity among other counterparts when compared to other counterparts. CONCLUSION: Eating habits have significantly altered among school students during the COVID-19 pandemic. In spite of some good healthy habits enhanced among students, the quantity and the quality of the food was compromised. Therefore, the responsible officials at the Ministry of Education must focus on enhancing school students' awareness towards increased intake of healthy food and adopting good eating habits during the spread of pandemics and health diseases to avoid its negative effects on students.",2021,"Appetite","163","","105222",33798621,"10.1016/j.appet.2021.105222","Middle East"

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the impacts of COVID-19 on household food security in Jordan, determined the percentage of food security and the levels of food insecurity during the quarantine, determined the associated factor with food insecurity, and determined main food groups associated with FINS during the quarantine. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a Web-based validated questionnaire. The Food Insecurity Experience Scale was used to measure the food insecurity during the first four weeks of the quarantine, and a modified food consumption score was used to determine the number of times the household consumes each food group. Univariate and multiple logistic regression models were used to describe, explore, and predict risk factors correlated with food insecurity among Jordanians, during the first four weeks of the quarantine. RESULTS: A total of 3129 Jordanians had responded to the assessment and fully answered the questionnaire. 23.1% of the total participants were severe food insecure, while 36.1% were moderate food insecure, 40.7% were food secure. The regression model demonstrated the monthly income per capita below the poverty line and a number of the family member (1-4 and 5-7) associated significantly with moderate food insecurity (OR: 5.33; 95% CI: 4.44-6.40, OR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.47-0.86, OR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.58-0.98, respectively). As well as with the severe food insecurity (OR: 6.87; 95% CI: 5.542-8.512, OR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.37-0.74, 0.64; 95% CI: 0.48-0.87, respectively).

Carbohydrates and the meat group were significantly related to food insecurity (p-value was <0.001 for both groups). CONCLUSION: Covid-19 and its subsequent quarantine have a tangible impact on food security levels for the populations. Awareness and strategies to support individuals at higher risks should be guided not only by the income but also by other risk factors identified in the present study as the number of persons in the family, younger adults (18-30 years old), and those who do not own their houses).",2020,"Clin Nutr ESPEN","40","","171-178",33183533,"10.1016/j.clnesp.2020.09.026","Middle East"

This study aims to assess the effect of the lockdown on body weight, eating habits, and physical activity of Jordanian youth (children and adolescents). METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on a sample of 477 Jordanian children and adolescents aged 6-17 y. The study tool was a structured validated questionnaire. It comprised 4 parts, including a general description of the study purpose, sociodemographic and anthropometric data, physical activity data, and food intake pattern. Questions were reported before and during lockdown. Changes in outcomes over the 2 study time points were evaluated. RESULTS: After the lockdown period, the mean body weight and body mass index for age Z-scores (BAZ) showed a significant increase (P < 0.001) compared with before the lockdown period. More than 50% of the subjects reported that they spent more than 3 h in front of the screen during the lockdown. The percent of subjects who watched TV for more than 3h was increased. Moreover, physical inactivity was increased significantly during the lockdown. All food groups consumption was significantly increased during the lockdown compared to before the lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 lockdown period was characterized by an increase in the use of screen-based devices, lower physical activity, uncontrolled food intake, and weight gain.",2021,"Disaster Med Public Health Prep","","","1-9",33588981,"10.1017/dmp.2021.48","Middle East"
"20","Does COVID-19 change dietary habits and lifestyle behaviours in Kuwait: a community-based cross-sectional study","Husain, W.; Ashkanani, F.","BACKGROUND: The coronavirus pandemic has transformed and continues to transform and affect the daily lives of communities worldwide, particularly due to the lockdown restrictions. Therefore, this study was designed to understand the changes in dietary and lifestyle behaviours that are major determinants of health during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted through an online questionnaire using a convenience sample of 415 adults living in Kuwait (age range 18-73 years). RESULTS: The rate of skipping breakfast remained consistent, with a slight increase during the pandemic. Lunch remained the main reported meal before and during COVID-19. Compared to before COVID-19, people were much more likely have a late-night snack or meal during COVID-19 (OR = 3.57 (95% CI 1.79-7.26), p < 0.001). Moreover, there was a drastic decrease in the frequency of fast-food consumption during COVID-19, up to 82% reported not consuming fast food (p < 0.001). There was a significant increase in the percentage of participants who had their main meal freshly made (OR = 59.18 (95% CI 6.55-1400.76), p = 0.001). Regarding food group patterns, no significant differences were found before and during the pandemic in terms of the weekly frequency of consumption, except in the case of fish and seafood. There were no remarkable changes in beverage consumption habits among participants before and during the pandemic, except for Americano coffee and fresh juice. Furthermore, there was a great reduction in physical activity and an increase in the amount of screen time and sedentary behaviours. A notable increase was detected in day-time sleep and a decrease in night-time sleep among participants. CONCLUSION: In general, this study indicates some changes in daily life, including changes in some eating practices, physical activity and sleeping habits during the pandemic. It is important that the government considers the need for nutrition education programmes and campaigns, particularly during this critical period of the pandemic in Kuwait.",2020,"Environ Health Prev Med","25","1","61",33045996,"10.1186/s12199-020-00901-5","Middle East"
"21","The impact of coronavirus covid-19 pandemic on food purchasing, eating behavior, and perception of food safety in Kuwait","Altarrah, D.; Alshami, E.; Alhamad, N.; Albesher, F.; Devarajan, S.","During the COVID-19 pandemic, the government in Kuwait implemented public health measures to control the spread of the virus. However, despite the importance of these restrictions, normal activities related to purchasing of groceries, concerns related to food safety, and overall uncertainty may have influenced food behaviors and food consumption. Hence, the study investigates the impact of COVID-19 on food purchasing behaviors, eating behaviors, and the perception of food safety and security among residents in Kuwait. A cross-sectional study was carried out using self-administered questionnaires between 28 July 2020 and 31 August 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic in Kuwait. A total of 841 respondents participated in the study. The study identified several changes in food purchasing behaviors, eating behaviors, food consumption, and consumers perceptions on food safety during the pandemic. The closures, restrictions, and changes in food purchasing evidently influenced individual’s eating behaviors. Largely, participants were found to (i) change their food purchasing behavior (74%); (ii) opt for online food delivery services (42.8%); (iii) purchase long-shelf-life foods (e.g., canned food and dry staples) (76%); (iv) consume more meals at home (76%); and (v) follow public health measures to reduce the spread of the virus and ensure their safety (98%). This study indicates that individuals during times of uncertainty and stress change their food purchasing behaviors, food consumption habits, and follow guidelines and recommendations. These findings may help public health initiatives to focus on raising awareness about the importance of health, wellbeing, and nutrition during times of crises. © 2021 by the authors.

S.; Charbel, L.","Purpose: Right after announcing the first cases, several governments worldwide have implemented stringent measures to stop the spread of COVID-19. This disruption in individuals' daily routines transformed food consumption habits. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on food consumption, diet and food shopping behaviors in Lebanon. Design/methodology/approach: The paper draws upon an online survey in Lebanon administered in Arabic and English through the Survey Monkey platform in the period of July 15—August 5, 2020, with 201 adults. The survey findings were analyzed using descriptive statistics, a paired sample t-test and a Phi correlation test. Findings: The research underlined numerous key consumer tendencies that are currently affecting diet and food behavior in Lebanon. Indeed, the study outcomes suggested (1) a move toward healthier diets; (2) a rise in the consumption of domestic products due to food safety concerns; (3) a change in the grocery shopping behaviors (with a rise in online shopping); (4) a surge of food stockpiling; and (5) a decrease in household food wastage. Surprisingly, COVID-19 seems to generate several positive changes toward more sustainable and healthier consumption patterns in Lebanon. Research limitations/implications: These findings contribute to the clarification and critical analysis of the impacts of COVID-19 on food behaviors in Lebanon, which would have several policy implications.

At the core of the study, a mobile application entitled Nutrition Assessment System (NAS) that simplified the data collection was used as toolkit and a technical test was carried out in all Lebanese governorates between November 2020 and March 2021. Findings show that food insecurity is an immediate problem for households in Beirut and in many governorates in Lebanon. Nine in every 16 households ate less than 2 meals per day and more than 70% of them skipped their meals to spare food. Even though half the population studied had a low food consumption score, 82.4% of the people were not relying on livelihood coping strategies. However, more than three out of ten of these households relied on at least three food-based coping strategies. In addition, as for the livelihoods, this assessment found that most Lebanese households reported a drop in income along with an expansion in debt incurrence in the last 24 months to be able to buy food. Improving food security in Lebanon requires effort not only on the part of the government, but through regional and international actions. © 2021 by the authors.

A.","The entire world is suffering from the post-COVID-19 crisis, and governments are facing problems concerning the provision of satisfactory food and services to their citizens through food supply chain systems. During pandemics, it is difficult to handle the demands of consumers, to overcome food production problems due to lockdowns, work with minimum manpower, follow import and export trade policies, and avoid transportation disruptions. This study aims to analyze the behavior of food imports in Saudi Arabia and how this pandemic and its resulting precautionary measures have affected the food supply chain. We performed a statistical analysis and extracted descriptive measures prior to applying hybrid statistical hypothesis tests to study the behavior of the food chain. The paired samples t-test was used to study differences while the independent samples t-test was used to study differences in means at the level of each item and country, followed by the comparison of means test in order to determine the difference and whether it is increasing or decreasing. According to the results, Saudi Arabia experienced significant effects on the number of items shipped and the countries that supplied these items. The paired samples t-test showed a change in the behavior of importing activities by—47% for items and countries. The independent t-test revealed that 24 item groups and 86 countries reflected significant differences in the mean between the two periods. However, the impact on 41 other countries was almost negligible. In addition, the comparison of means test found that 68% of item groups were significantly reduced and 24% were increased, while only 4% of the items remained the same. From a country perspective, 65% of countries showed a noticeable decrease and 16% a significant increase, while 19% remained the same. © 2021 by the authors.

K.; Alashmali, S.","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced governments around the world to impose strict hygiene and national lockdown measures, which in turn has changed the dietary and lifestyle habits of the world's population. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate whether dietary and physical activity behaviors of Saudi Arabia's adult population changed during the COVID-19 quarantine. METHODS: An electronic questionnaire which assessed changes in body weight, dietary habits, and physical activity of Saudi Arabia's adult population (n = 2255) during the COVID-19 quarantine was distributed on social media between June and July 2020. To test the differences between changes in dietary and physical activity behaviors in relation to changes in body weight a Chi-square test was used. RESULTS: Over 40 and 45% of participants reported eating and snacking more, respectively, which led to weight gain in around 28%. Most participants reported that they consumed home-cooked (73%) and healthy meals (47%), while only 7% reported that they consumed foods from restaurants. Feelings of boredom and emptiness (44%) and the availability of time for preparing meals (40%) were the main reasons for changing dietary habits. Honey (43%) and vitamin C (50%) were the most consumed immune-boosting food and dietary supplement, respectively. COVID-19 also had a negative impact on physical activity, lowering the practice in 52% subjects, which was associated with significant weight gain (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Assessing the changes to the population's dietary habits and physical activity during the lockdown will help predict the outcome of the population's future health and wellbeing after the pandemic.",2021,"BMC Public Health","21","1","1487",34330241,"10.1186/s12889-021-11540-y","Middle East"

A.; Raz, O.; Kaufman-Shriqui, V.","The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has been associated with both increased anxiety, deterioration in diet and weight gain. These associations may differ by sex. The present report examines differences by sex in diet quality in order to determine whether associations between diet and psychological stress during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic differed by sex. This online study is available internationally in seven languages. The Mediterranean Diet Score was used to measure diet quality, while the General Anxiety Disorder 7-point scale (GAD-7) was used to measure anxiety. Findings were compared by self-reported sex (male vs. female). A total of 3797 respondents provided informed consent and met eligibility criteria, of whom 526 women were omitted due to being pregnant or six months or less post-partum, or due to reproductive status not being reported. Thus, 3271 individuals are included in the present report, of whom 71.2% were women. The median age of women was 30 (interquartile range (IQR) = 16) years vs. 31 (IQR = 19) years, p = 0.079. The median diet quality score was 9 (IQ = 3) in both women and men (p = 0.75). Despite the overall similarity in diet score, several components of the score differed significantly by sex. Women reported consuming significantly more olive oil, daily servings of vegetables, and weekly servings of sweet baked goods. Men reported consuming significantly more sweetened/carbonated drinks, red meat, alcohol, legumes, and hummus/tahini. Women reported a GAD-7 score of 6 (IQR = 8), while men reported 3 (6), p < 0.001. An inverse association was detected between the Mediterranean diet score and the GAD-7 score in both women (rho = -0.166, p < 0.001) and men (rho = -0.154, p < 0.001), and the correlation coefficients did not differ by sex (p = 0.76). Mediterranean diet score and age both reduced the odds of elevated anxiety (GAD-7 ≥ 10), while female sex, deterioration of diet quality during the outbreak, unemployment, and completing the survey in English increased the odds of this outcome. During the COVID-19 lockdowns, overall diet quality did not differ by sex; however, some differences by sex in components of the total score were detected. Moderate to severe anxiety was positively associated with female sex and poorer diet quality even after controlling for age, employment status, and the language in which the survey was performed.",2021,"Nutrients","13","12","",34959744,"10.3390/nu13124193","Middle East"
